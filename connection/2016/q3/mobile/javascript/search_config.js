I’m in a reflective kind of mood as we take the opportunity to look again at our plans for the year ahead and start to get working on our next adviser guide to platforms.<br/>Writing that isn’t going to be easy; mainly because there is such a dearth of interesting new stuff to talk about. First world problems and all that, but very few providers have anything happening which we’d think of as moving the industry on.<br/>This in turn has got me thinking about where the next wave of propositions will come from in terms of adviser-facing technology. And I think that’s my theme for this quarter – to what extent can you look to your direct peer-group and competition to get ideas on how to evolve your own propositions?<br/>All industries are guilty of being inward- looking and displaying confirmation bias. But I do wonder if financial planning and advice is a little more enthusiastic in this regard than others – very often I’ve heard advisers dismiss different ideas as unworthy of consideration on the basis that they haven’t come from financial planners or advisers.<br/>I think that might be a mistake.<br/>Here’s a case in point. Over the summer we’ve seen the launch of (yet) another online investing proposition; this time a<br/>port from the USA called Scalable Capital. Now, Scalable is a bit of a thorny proposition in terms of actually using it as a way of getting recalcitrant or first-time investors<br/>to get going – for one thing its minimum investment is £10,000.<br/>What interests me about it in terms of<br/>how it might impact advisers’ worlds is<br/>its approach to portfolio management. It helpfully sets this out in a 32-page white paper which is worth a read (really). In short, it reacts against modern portfolio theory and Markowitz in favour of working much more closely to risk parameters – in fact its 23 portfolio gradations are all labelled with Value at Risk (VaR) figures. The theory goes that it is far easier to predict risk through modelling than returns, so the models<br/>are continuously adjusted to ensure they stay on risk budget. This, according to the<br/>Nobel-winning research that SC quotes, will generally do a much better job of controlling outcomes than mechanistic rebalancing to an asset allocation model.<br/>I spent a bit of time poking this stuff with a stick, and while I’m no-one’s idea of a quant, I thought it had some resonance. But it won’t come easy to advisers, and here’s why.<br/>Since RDR, the overwhelming trend for<br/>firms has been toward model portfolio usage; whether insourced, off-the-shelf or outsourced to a discretionary manager’s MPS. In recent research we published with CWC Research, we found well over 50%<br/>of firms saying they never made asset allocation decisions, let alone individual stock decisions. Virtually all of those portfolios<br/>use target asset allocations and periodic rebalancing back to target.<br/>Is that approach because there’s no alternative, or because it’s what advisers have been educated into wanting, and what<br/>","5<br/>The revolution in terms of how tech can influence the advice profession has only just begun. The big advances almost certainly won’t come from within the sector.<br/>adviser platform technology is able to house? The alternative approach of Scalable Capital requires continual monitoring, modelling and trading of the constituent funds and ETFs, and only some of this can be automated through algorithms – at least for the moment.<br/>Let’s assume, for a moment, that Scalable’s approach does give better results than efficient-frontier-modern-portfolio-asset- allocated-rebalanced. It might or might not do in real life, but it’s convenient for illustrating the point anyway. For it to take off for advisers it would need to:<br/>• Be available across multiple platforms<br/>• Be supported by free or near-free trading of ETFs as well as mutual funds<br/>• Be largely automated<br/>• Have completely different client reporting (constant contract notes etc. wouldn’t help)<br/>There are a bunch of tech hurdles in that; all of which are doable (nearly anything in tech is doable with enough energy and money). But more problematic for any provider selling this into advisers would be getting firms to change what they’ve just got used to doing since RDR. With sunset just past, some firms are only now getting to the latter stages of cleaning up their client banks and developing<br/>a systemised investment proposition (I’m excluding bespoke, discretionary firms here). How to explain to staff, advisers and clients that actually the approach you’ve just got them happy with isn’t all that and a bag of chips any more?<br/>I spoke at a regulatory offsite meeting a while ago at which the nice people expressed some frustration that all they needed advisers to do in order to deal with their latest proclamation on what colour your pants have to be on a Thursday or something was stop for a moment, think how it affected their business, put plans into place and then get on with it.<br/>Needless to say, very few of the people in the room had an appropriate understanding of what that means for businesses. It was my pleasure to put them straight; to this day apparently no-one has quite used language like that in any other meeting they’ve been to. I’m taking that as a positive.<br/>But here’s the thing. There will come a point when hanging onto something because it’s the last big change you made, or because it’s what the technology you picked allows you to do easily, won’t be the right thing any more. Advisers have ridden out more change than just about any other sector I can think of, and always come out on top.<br/>That’s because, in the end, nothing trumps the personal relationship between an adviser and a client. But in an environment where more and more firms are starting to find ways to serve clients remotely and at a lower cost, can we be sure that this trump card will still be<br/>up the sleeve of the industry at the next big go-round? How ready are advisers to leave behind the new normal and embrace even more radical changes to working practices?<br/>Going back to the regulator for a moment,<br/>I think this might be what’s behind its exhortation to foster a ‘culture of challenge’ in firms. In my firm we call it something different and borrow from William Faulkner’s writing tip. We call it ‘killing your darlings’ and it’s also what gave me the title for this column. We can’t hold our existing practices too dearly, or too tightly. Good ideas can come from anywhere.<br/>The revolution in terms of how tech can influence the advice profession has only just begun. The big advances almost certainly won’t come from within the sector. The question is whether existing firms will be able to acknowledge that the existing way things are being done (although it’s come a long way) won’t get out of here alive, and pick<br/>the very best from what’s in development, wherever it’s from.<br/>","6<br/>Longevity and Survival Probability in Retirement Income Modelling<br/>Abraham Okusanya | Principal | FinalytiQ<br/>The fear of dying is right up there on the list of top fears people have. But maybe, the fear of public speaking is even higher on that list. Maybe I’ve got this all wrong but if that’s true, then it seems to me that when the average person goes to a funeral, they’ll rather be in the casket than do the eulogy?<br/>But I digress. Perhaps for many people, particularly those approaching retirement, the greatest fear shouldn’t be the fear<br/>of untimely death, but that of living too long! Planning for retirement is particularly challenging because we are planning for<br/>a finite, but precisely unknown period of time. And without the proverbial crystal ball, estimating clients’ longevity is rather tricky. Yet as part of the financial planning process, advisers are constantly called upon to make judgement/assumptions on how long clients are likely to live.<br/>Life Expectancy: A Flawed Measure for Retirement Income Planning<br/>One common but flawed approach for estimating life expectancy is to simply look at the life expectancy tables, based on the client’s age and sex. For instance, a 65-year- old man in the UK has a life expectancy of 19 years, while a woman of the same age has a life expectancy of 21 years.<br/>This approach is flawed, for several reasons. One, life expectancy is the ‘mean’ number<br/>of remaining years and there’s at least a<br/>50% chance someone in that age group<br/>will outlive their life expectancy! But more crucially, it fails to account for improvements in mortality as people get older. The ONS has two types of life expectancy measure;<br/>1. the period life expectancy which shows life expectancy at a given period e.g. for a 65-year old male in 2015, and<br/>2. the Cohort life expectancy which tracks a given cohort who share the same year of birth and takes account of improvement in mortality.<br/>The table below compiled by Birmingham University academic Dr Paul Cox, shows that mortality improvements add about 3 years to life expectancy.<br/>Dr Paul Cox (2015) Helping consumers and providers manage defined contribution wealth in retirement.<br/>","7<br/>Table4<br/>Survival Probability at age 65<br/>Perhaps for many people, particularly those approaching retirement, the greatest fear shouldn’t be the fear of untimely death, but that of living<br/>too long!<br/>Survival Probability<br/>An obvious way to manage longevity is simply to use an annuity to insure against the risk of living too long. Short of using annuities, longevity in the context of retirement planning is best approached in terms of survival probability. This gives us a clearer idea of the chances that someone will live till a certain age.<br/>This is one reason I believe that deterministic cash flow models are inadequate in retirement planning, because the challenge that we are dealing with is by its very nature uncertain and thus probabilistic. As these tables show, there is an 11% chance a 65-year old male will celebrate their 100th birthday and that rises to 15% for a female of the same age. The implication of this is that we need to bring the survival probability into context in retirement income modelling<br/>Survival probability can easily feed into a Monte Carlo model to enable more robust discussions with clients about how long they are likely to live, what the likely success rate of their financial plan is and more importantly what financial resources they have in place in the event of extreme longevity. This enables the planner to calibrate the financial plans accordingly.<br/>It’s estimated that around 75% of people over age 65 live as couples and the chance that at least one of a 65-year old couple would live to age 100 is a whopping 24%!<br/>Estimating the Real Probability of Success<br/>Consider a case where a planner determines that a 3% inflation-adjusted withdrawal rate (net of 1% fee) from a 60/40 portfolio has<br/>a 90% probability of success over a 30 year horizon – which means a 10% chance of failure or more precisely a 10% chance that they<br/>will need to make some adjustment to their withdrawal in the event of poor return sequence.<br/>Yet, since there’s only a 48% percent change that at least one member of the 65-year old couple is going to live to age 95, the overall probability of failure is actually 4.8% (10% X 48%) – i.e. a whopping 95.2% probability of success! This is because there are two unrelated probabilities here –<br/>1. the probability of having a poor sequence of return over a 30-year period AND<br/>2. the probability that at least one member of a 65-year old couple is going to survive 30 years<br/>The failure of this simple financial plan requires those two events to happen – i.e. poor sequence of return that ruins a 3% withdrawal rate over a 30-year period AND at least one member of the couple to survive 30 years. Those odds are completely independent and unrelated, and the probability of both happening is actually less than the probability of either of them happening. This is in<br/>the realms of what math nerds refer to as ‘conditional probability!’<br/>The implication of all these is that longevity is a huge consideration in retirement income planning and it’s an area where financial planning can add real value. Managing longevity risk in the context of retirement is best approached using survival probability, rather than simply inputting a number, like say age 100 into the cashflow tool.<br/>","","","10<br/>M&G Multi Asset Team Market Outlook July 2016<br/>Unusual uncertainty?<br/>Financial markets have had a rather turbulent time in 2016, to date. It has been difficult to pinpoint a single cause of all this volatility, especially when looking at the fundamental picture. Market participants who are in the mood to fret have been able to take their pick of things to worry about: Certain US data points, China’s economic slowdown, central bank action, or inaction, politics, and so on.<br/>After the initial shock of the UK’s vote to leave the EU on 24 June, a sense of calm appears to have been restored in recent weeks. However, although most questions about the ongoing consequences of the referendum result remain unanswered, for many, attention now turns to the next ‘event’. Over the coming months we will see several meetings of major central banks, political events – including the US presidential election – and undoubtedly some things we do not even know about yet. Market commentators will argue that each event in turn will be critically important for investors, but many will be quickly forgotten as something else takes over the headlines.<br/>These phases of turbulence are highly unsettling and can have a negative impact on investor psychology that persists for an extended period, leaving sentiment nervous and fickle. This suggests volatility could easily re-emerge at any time. It feels like there<br/>are heightened levels of uncertainty at the moment, but we must remember uncertainty is a permanent feature of the global investment landscape. Therefore, we have not changed our core approach in dealing with the current environment.<br/>For us, as always, it is vital to assess the likely genuine economic impact of any event and then ask ourselves whether we have had enough new information to change<br/>our conclusions about the medium-term attractions of various assets? If not, we would then be on the lookout to exploit any unwarranted shifts in valuation.<br/>A shift in beliefs, not facts<br/>Despite the high degree of volatility in recent months, overall we do not believe we have seen enough new information in terms of changes to the fundamental picture to revise our view that, in aggregate, the global outlook remains broadly positive.<br/>We do recognise the need for cautious optimism, given that global growth has<br/>been modest with a significant amount<br/>of divergence at sector and regional level. However, our base case at present is that global recession seems unlikely given positive trends in key areas such as US labour market data, easy monetary policy in much of the world, and still low commodity prices.<br/>That said, we believe current market conditions require us to be tactical. Thus, careful timing and scaling is of high importance. We understand that volatility can be very uncomfortable, but we believe that those who can tolerate it in the short term could well be rewarded with higher prospective returns over more meaningful time horizons.<br/>While we have found little fundamental evidence to support a case for global recession, sentiment has clearly shifted.<br/>We believe heightened volatility over the past year or so is attributable to an erosion in confidence about a return to ‘normal’, that is, higher levels of economic growth than those seen since 2008.<br/>Where do we find value today?<br/>A quick look at a range of conventional valuation metrics reveals the current situation as being one in which deep pessimism about the durability of economic growth prevails. The result has been a preference for assets with higher degrees of certainty about a return of capital, over those with some degree of hope of a higher return on capital. A myopic aversion to short-term volatility is prioritised over potential material upside.<br/>This demand for ‘safety’ and capital preservation manifests itself clearly in the very low or even negative real yields on many mainstream government bonds today. This means investors are often effectively paying for the privilege of lending money to developed market governments.<br/>The flip side of extremely low levels of return on ‘safety’ assets is elevated prospective returns on ‘risky’ assets. Therefore, selected equity, non-mainstream government bonds and corporate bonds are currently sitting<br/>at attractive levels of valuation. However,<br/>at such low levels of yield on mainstream government bonds, risk assets do not even have to be abnormally attractively priced in an absolute sense to be attractive to multi-asset investors. The main valuation anomaly we observe today remains the size of the equity-risk premium (see chart), which we believe reflects overly fearful sentiment.<br/>","11<br/>Financial markets have had a rather turbulent time in 2016, to date. It has been difficult to pinpoint a single cause of all this volatility, especially when looking at the fundamental picture.<br/>It is worth pointing out that, since 2008, a ‘volatility-averse’ approach has been profitable in that biasing portfolios to being long of mainstream government bonds has been rewarded in recent years. This may persist or intensify in the short term but this is a finite game. Ultimately, strong capital gains from bonds come at the expense of future returns<br/>– as yields fall, prospective returns decline as investors effectively take some of the future returns up front. We believe the enjoyment of this journey has distracted investors from the fact that it is unsustainable. Ultimately, gravity reasserts itself and ignoring this could prove very risky indeed.<br/>Equities offer compelling real yield versus bonds<br/>Given the evolution of economic beliefs towards a more pessimistic view of the world, together with the elevated equity-risk premium and credit spreads, the most appropriate strategy from here would seem to be to take on some of the volatility associated with ‘risk’ assets and avoid exposure to expensive ’safety’.<br/>We believe the current obsession with volatility is counter-productive and misses<br/>the point about what actually matters on a multi-year view. Owning assets that have in the recent past delivered good returns but now stand at valuations that imply this cannot be repeated, is a very dangerous strategy.<br/>M&G July 2016<br/>Source: Datastream, Bloomberg, 30 April 2016.

After years of low interest rates following the financial crisis, many assets may look expensive when viewed using traditional valuation metrics.<br/>We think it best to avoid constructing portfolios based on simplistic, top-down ideas of value, and instead take a cautious and forensic approach to picking investments, with a focus on higher-quality assets held<br/>in a conservative fashion. By doing this, we<br/>believe, the severity of drawdowns can be reduced. The process requires investors take the time to thoroughly understand the true nature of their exposures by building their portfolio from the ‘bottom-up’.<br/>The chart opposite shows the maximum drawdowns experienced by different strategies which adopt a more or less conservative approach to asset selection in some of the key pro-growth asset classes. The results may be surprising to some, however, they validate our belief that by understanding asset class behaviours we are able to build a quality portfolio which can achieve a desired outcome.<br/>After years of<br/>low interest rates following the financial crisis, many assets may look expensive when viewed using traditional valuation metrics.<br/>","13<br/>0 -10 -20 -30 -40 -50 -60 -70<br/>-4%<br/>-47%<br/>-49%<br/>MSCI World quality<br/>MSCI World high dividend yield<br/>Global high yield BBB/BB only Global high yield (CCC)<br/>-57%<br/>Equities<br/>-62% MSCI World<br/>High yield<br/>Emerging market debt<br/>EM Sovereign debt (local, hedged) EM Sovereign debt (local, USD)<br/>-31%<br/>-22%<br/>The Investec Diversified income Fund aims to fill the role that income can no longer fill.<br/>A defensive multi-asset fund, it seeks to provide attractive income with long-term growth.<br/>• Attractive income - aims to provide 4-6% p.a.•<br/>• Sustainable income - global multi-asset portfolio seeking to grow capital<br/>• Lower volatility - historic volatility less than 50% of UK equities<br/>• Taxefficiency-classifiedasan‘interest-paying’fund<br/>• Activity managed - by co-Head of Multi-Asset Income John Stopford and team. *Gross of fees, over a 3-year rolling period. This is an aim and not guaranteed.<br/>Maximum drawdown over 10 years<br/>Within equities, the perception that a company’s high dividend yield conveys protection to its investors is erroneous. Simply because a company is paying out<br/>a high proportion of its earnings does not mean that there should be confidence in the sustainability of its business model or that its management are focused on maximizing the interests of shareholders. It can, instead, mean that the company is in distress or that investors have forced its share price down in anticipation of a cut in the dividend.<br/>Similarly, rather than looking at the immediate attractions of high yield bonds, a more defensive approach aims to understand a company’s relative profitability, earnings stability and debt-burden. We define businesses which compare favourably on these grounds, whether considered from<br/>a debt or equity perspective, as ‘quality’ corporations allowing us to judge the sustainability of the income they offer and properly compare their relative valuations.<br/>Source: Bloomberg, Investec Asset Management, May 2016<br/>As shown in the chart within the high yield asset class, it can be seen that those at the bottom of the credit rating spectrum (and whose average yield over the last 10 years has been nearly double that of their more highly rated peers) suffered a drawdown nearly 20 percentage points worse than the less risky BBB/BB issues.<br/>Finally, within emerging market debt,<br/>a thorough understanding of the risks<br/>posed by the nation’s debt also requires<br/>an intricate understanding of its currency markets. In many cases the volatility of an emerging economy’s exchange rate will far outweigh that of its bond market and so expose investors to risks that extend beyond a county’s ability to services its debts. It<br/>is therefore important to consider such investments on a currency hedged basis when comparing their relative valuations and to analyse their currency separately.<br/>Avoid unnecessary diversification<br/>By applying a bottom-up approach across the Investec Diversified Income Fund’s portfolio, we believe investors gain a further advantage: the avoidance of ‘diworsification’. This is the situation in which investments are made<br/>in the hope of diversification but actually have the effect of doing little if anything<br/>to reduce overall risk and instead merely increase trading costs and erode the portfolio manager’s knowledge of and conviction in their investments.<br/>Conclusion<br/>By consistently applying a defensive<br/>quality orientated bottom-up approach to investment selection within the Investec Diversified Income Fund, we believe, we are in a better position to produce a portfolio with structural integrity, making us better equipped to handle episodes of market weakness. This requires an intense focus on bottom-up analysis and the consideration of positions<br/>on a holistic basis, rather than in isolation. By reducing the impact of drawdowns on the portfolio, investors are able to improve the probability of meeting their goals over the long run.<br/>For further information please visit www.investecassetmanagement.com/DIF<br/>THIS COMMUNICATION IS DIRECTED ONLY AT PROFESSIONAL FINANCIAL ADVISORS.

Amazon, Uber and Airbnb are all examples of these: brands that challenge old business models, leaving established companies wondering where they went wrong.<br/>Customers who have grown up in this world - millennials (people who are currently aged 18-33) - will make up 75% of the global workforce in ten years’ time. If they’re three quarters of the global workforce, they’re also going to be a large slice of your potential client book.<br/>So how do you attract and retain clients for whom a traditional sense of brand loyalty is a thing of the past? In this article, I’ll discuss two ways of fostering brand loyalty: having a sense of purpose and making and keeping your promises.<br/>According to Michael Hayman, who we were lucky enough to have speak at our Investment Symposium earlier this year, having a sense<br/>of mission is more important than ever. In<br/>his book, Mission, he explains that successful businesses now need to explain why they exist. It’s not enough to focus simply on products or solutions – that’s what you do. Nor is it enough to focus on processes and people – that’s how you to it. The mission provides the why.<br/>To convey a sense of mission, first of all you need to create one that feels authentic to you and your business. At Vanguard, we see our mission as follows: to take a stand for<br/>all investors, to treat them fairly, and to give them the best chance for investment success. We try to ensure that everything we do links back to that core purpose. When defining your mission, it needs to be convincing not only for you, but for your whole team. The best communicators of your firm’s mission<br/>will be those of your employees who are inspired by it, and get a sense of meaning from it.<br/>The next step is to define this mission at every touch point you have with your client, especially on your website and on any literature you produce.<br/>The second important factor that has an impact on brand loyalty is to do with the promises you make to clients. It’s not only<br/>It’s not enough to focus simply on products or solutions – that’s what you do. Nor is it enough to focus on processes and people – that’s how you to it. The mission provides the why.<br/>","17<br/>While brand loyalty can be an elusive quality to inspire, creating and articulating an authentic sense of mission can be a powerful tool for differentiation.<br/>about keeping your promises, but also about ensuring you make the right ones in the first place, as well as understanding that even an implied promise needs to be kept.<br/>Many advisers have implicitly based their client ‘promise’ on an uncontrollable outcome, such as the performance of their chosen asset classes and managers. But<br/>as we’ve seen over recent turbulent years, performance-based promises can quickly and easily destroy credibility. It’s better to anchor a service promise only on things that you can confidently predict and control.<br/>A service promise should focus specifically on client needs, with everything you do being a means to a client’s end. You can demonstrate this to your client by relating your actions explicitly and clearly to your promise, for example saying, “As promised, here is your quarterly review statement. Let me talk you through it, in light of your plan to retire five years early.” An adviser’s brochure should let a prospective client know exactly what is being promised. However, don’t fall into the trap<br/>of overpromising. It’s tempting to think that the more you promise a client, the better.<br/>It’s actually best practice to keep promises<br/>to a credible minimum. The longer a list of promises is, the less credible it is, and clients begin to doubt whether a firm can really deliver. By making and delivering a shorter and more achievable list of promises, you can<br/>start building trust with clients. Perceptions are built up by repeated experiences – if you continually exceed service expectations by delivering on your promises again and again, you will create powerful client loyalty.<br/>How can you ensure you deliver on your promises? Work back from the desired outcome for your client by asking yourself what it will take to make this a reality<br/>for them.<br/>each step of the process must be understood, planned and resourced. So, understanding your firm’s talents and capabilities should inform the promise you make to your clients in the first place.<br/>While brand loyalty can be an elusive quality to inspire, creating and articulating an authentic sense of mission can be a powerful tool for differentiation. This, coupled with a solid record of delivering on your promises, will help your firm attract and retain clients.<br/>This information is directed at professional investors and should not be distributed to, or relied upon by, retail investors.

They do this by creating value for customers and then sharing in this value. If companies don’t add value, for example, if their jewellery is “crap” (as Gerald Ratner famously said about his own company’s products) then the customer stops buying the product and the company goes bust (Ratner wiped £500m off the value of his company with his infamous quote).<br/>Customers are happy to share some of their value with industries that generate value for them. People pay the car industry because they value the ability to get them safely and reliably from A to B.<br/>The Financial Services industry and the companies within it create value for themselves. Financial Services has many layers in the complete value chain – when investing, for example, there are financial advisers, platforms, CRM systems, messaging services, stockbrokers, foreign exchange dealers, fund managers, wrapper providers etc., all of whom extract (to varying degrees) some of the value. But, of course, without the customers’ money in the first place there is no value for any element of the value chain to share in! So it is often the element closest to the customer that can demand the largest share of the value chain.<br/>In simple terms we might think of three key elements – manufacturer (who assembles the product), distributor (who moves the product from the manufacturer to the customer and the brand (that finds the customer) and sells the product/service.<br/>An example might help:<br/>Intel is a microchip manufacturer. It supplies chips to many computer brands such as<br/>Dell, HP etc. If it had no relationship or<br/>value to the customer, then it would be a simple commodity and have to take the<br/>price demanded by the more powerful (in a customer relationship sense) brands. But Intel spends money on advertising to convince the customer of the value of the “Intel Inside” effect – faster, better, smarter processors. And thus demands a greater share of the value chain because they are happy to pay more for a PC with an Intel chip inside.<br/>Brands (close to the customer) dominate value chains<br/>Returning to Financial Services, it is the financial adviser / planner that has the customer relationship (finding the customers, building the advice plan, pulling together<br/>the investment, protection tax wrapper components and taking the risk of complaint / compensation for errors). But oddly, historically, the adviser didn’t get the largest share of the value chain. This is a hangover from pre-RDR days.<br/>","19<br/>Without the customers’ money in the first place there is no value for any element of the value chain to share in! So it is often the element closest to the customer that can demand the largest share of the value chain.<br/>The dominant brand was the product provider with the IFA just the distributor, indeed the investment industry will often still refer to IFAs as “a distribution channel”. The Brand (provider) pulled the tax wrapper and investment components together, managed the customer communication (statements and valuations), provided the customer call centre, and took the strain of new business. They also paid the distributor a fee (known as commission) for finding “their” customers!<br/>Pre RDR<br/>But the world is changing – slowly but surely. Advisers are starting to demand more of<br/>the value chain. They, after all, are taking<br/>on more of the role of a brand – service, reporting, CRM and risk!<br/>In the process, they are demanding and will rightly continue to demand more of the value chain. An old-fashioned fund of fund (with trail commission, underlying funds, supermarket rebates, dealing fee) might have cost the customer 4.4% pa – out of which the IFA was paid 0.5% pa (only 11% of the value chain). Today many advisers and planners are trying to keep the total<br/>customer cost to a maximum of 2% pa and charge an ongoing advice / servicing fee of 0.75% pa (still only 38% of the value chain).<br/>The New Value Chain<br/>The overall price charged (or value extracted) by the whole value chain is under pressure<br/>– partly from regulators but also from<br/>the simple fact that for the investment component the long run returns of asset classes cannot sustain high cost levels. Historically (over the last 50 years or so) Equities and Gilts in the UK have returned about 5% and 2% over inflation respectively (source: Barclays Equity Gilt Study 2016).<br/>So a typical 60:40 split would generate 3.8% pa. Trying to charge more than 2% is just not sustainable – because the customer will rightly say, “you are taking more than half the total value – and it’s my money you are putting at risk!”<br/>The Other Advice Gap<br/>An issue for advisers wanting to grow their share of value is that they need scale and good processes to drive the price of the components (CRM, Platform, Investment, PI etc.) down. And some of these<br/>components e.g. fund managers, have spent many years investing in the brands to defend / argue their value.<br/>If a discretionary manager or fund of<br/>fund manager wants 0.5% pa (plus VAT<br/>and dealing), the underlying funds in the portfolio have an average fee of 0.7% pa and the platform wants 0.4% pa (plus tax wrappers) – then there is precious little gap left for an advice fee!<br/>One way the advisers (and fund managers) are driving down costs is by the use<br/>of passive funds. A broadly diversified portfolio of passive funds and ETFs can<br/>be constructed for around 0.25 % pa or less. Finding more efficient platforms with inclusive dealing fees may cost around 0.3% pa. Using risk managed models or advisory portfolios can reduce or remove the DFM fee. Assuming a DFM of say 0.3% pa inc. VAT then the total cost would come it at around 0.85% pa – for a well-diversified<br/>risk managed portfolio. Plenty of room for<br/>a 0.85% pa advice / service fee and still coming in at less than 2% pa total cost – and with the adviser rightly taking half of the value.<br/>The next challenge for advisers and planners is how to show that they are worth 0.85% pa – we will look at that in the next article.<br/>","20<br/>Are we professional enough yet?<br/>Kaavya Dijendranath | Marketing specialist | FE<br/>Let’s for a moment rewind to the summer of 2012 – the personal finance section of the Daily Telegraph published a research study that found that the television character most closely associated with the term ‘’financial adviser’’ was the market trader Del Boy, from the popular sitcom Only Fools and Horses.<br/>It’s no wonder the Financial Conduct Authority’s most far reaching set of regulation, more fondly called the Retail Distribution Review was enforced in December that year. The RDR set out to overturn such negative stereotypes of advisers by making the provision of financial advice to investors more professional and fair.<br/>At the time, most advisers were broadly supportive, with a number of adviser networks and trade bodies backing the Personal Finance Society’s Consumer Confidence Campaign that used the RDR to change consumers’ views and build trust in financial advice.<br/>Fast forward to 2016 and one can’t help<br/>but wonder if the objectives of RDR have<br/>been fully achieved? Was the overall bid for professionalism lost in the detail of the more controversial aspects of the regulation (fines, fees, future of financial advice...)? Has the RDR really helped to promote and build trust in the financial advisory profession?<br/>Investor behaviour research published in the last few months has indicated that the rift between advisers and investors still exists. Boring Money’s Spring Census published in April 2016 that surveyed 2,042 UK adults found that only 8% of adults are prepared<br/>to pay more than £100 an hour for advice.<br/>A third of the households with £100,000 to £150,000 of savings and investments said they would pay up to just £50 an hour for advice – the same percentage said they would not be prepared to pay anything for service.<br/>The report further highlighted the fact that 25.45 million UK adults have a savings or investment product, yet just 4.1 million adults are reported to be in an ongoing relationship with an adviser. Similar research from Legg Mason found that 60% of the 5,000 over 40 high net worth individuals were not prepared to pay anything for advice. Adam Gent, Head of UK sales at Legg Mason said that the research was rather surprising three years after the introduction of the RDR...<br/>So why don’t people engage in financial advice?<br/>Engage Insight research sponsored by IRESS highlights the lack of trust in financial advisers by the wider public as one of the top reasons. FT Adviser analysis around this issue points to the issue of lack of perceived value in advice compared to other professions.<br/>Improving professionalism is key to building trust and the RDR set out to achieve this by<br/>Only 8% of adults are prepared to pay more than £100 an hour for advice.<br/>","21<br/>25.45 million UK adults have a savings or investment product, yet just 4.1 million adults are reported to be in an ongoing relationship with an adviser.<br/>making professional qualifications mandatory and setting out requirements for CPD in<br/>the run up to 2012. But at the time, in the midst of having to rebuild business models<br/>to accommodate fees and pass a number of exams, CPD was generally viewed as just another box to tick in order to attain the required Statement of Professional Standing (Professional Adviser, 2016).<br/>However, investing more time and resource into well diversified CPD programmes can be of great value to advisers. Tom Hegarty from New Model Business Academy views CPD<br/>as an extremely rewarding process which is beneficial not just for an adviser or his/her firm but also the investors and clients that they serve.<br/>Although the FCA specifies within its training and competence requirements that a number of areas should be covered under the CPD rules, it does not recommend any guidelines or provide a framework on what these areas should be. Tom adds that often advisers pick up their 35 hours in a ‘piecemeal’ fashion which means that too many advisers are<br/>still not reaping the benefits on offer from a balanced and tailored personalised CPD plan. (‘’Making sure CPD is on your side’’, Professional Adviser, 2016)<br/>Staying relevant in today’s fast paced financial landscape is a concern for many advisers, as<br/>they are faced with the challenge of having to alter their propositions in response to the rise of D2C platforms, self-investing websites, robo-advice and a growing new millennial market.<br/>A thoughtfully created CPD plan covering areas such as technology, business development, personal development and industry insight can help advisers stay up to<br/>by providing additional training, knowledge and ongoing support.

Currently, it’s a shambles. No-one yet knows what ‘Leave’ actually means – there certainly wasn’t any attempt to describe it on the voter slip. We do at least have a leader, but the country is without a plan, or an effective opposition at a time of great uncertainty. Meanwhile we are at the mercy of capital markets, who have delivered their immediate ‘vote’ through a collapse in Sterling to levels last seen in 1985.<br/>The referendum result pits 52% of the country against the other 48% – hardly a recipe for social harmony. If direct democracy is about reflecting the will of the people, then Scotland’s resounding vote in favour of ‘Remain’ effectively ends the 300-year old Union. They didn’t put that on the ballot.<br/>We have a Prime Minister who actually voted for ‘Remain’. May can be expected to continue making the right noises about enforcing the will of the people, simultaneously placating the Eurosceptic wing of the party. The fact is, however, that about 60% of Tory MPs voted to ‘Remain’ in the European Union. On the other side of the chamber, about 95% of Labour MPs voted to ‘Remain’, meaning about three quarters of all MPs voted to ‘Remain’. This majority must now preside over legislation to implement a policy they think is wrong.<br/>All the while, confidence in the UK economy will be ailing, companies will refrain from making investments, property markets will be in a mini-collapse and the media will be gleefully peddling new scare stories of the economic, rather than the immigration kind.<br/>The electorate is fickle - opinion polls will show public opinion changing due to an uptick in inflation, economic distress and job insecurity. ‘Bremorse’ is already rampant. Politicians will get the blame, and they will want to adjust their positions. A vote of no confidence in the Government only requires a simple majority to succeed, so there is a very real possibility that the referendum result is ‘trumped’ by a General Election in which the same battle is fought again, this time with the benefit of hindsight.<br/>Without an overwhelmingly strong mandate either from the electorate or from Parliament, therefore, Brexit may not be a foregone conclusion. Even if it progresses, it is virtually inconceivable that any feasible form of Brexit will meet the expectations of ‘Leave’ voters. Not only would the scale of the project<br/>The referendum result pits 52% of the country against the other 48% – hardly a recipe for social harmony.<br/>","23<br/>Without an overwhelmingly strong mandate either from the electorate or from Parliament, therefore, Brexit may not be a foregone conclusion. Even if it progresses, it is virtually inconceivable that any feasible form of Brexit will meet the expectations of ‘Leave’ voters.<br/>overwhelm Britain’s civil service resources,<br/>but Britain’s negotiating team will have a<br/>weak political mandate, and will be wary<br/>of the rug of popular support being pulled<br/>out from underneath them at any time. Economic distress in the UK will further whet the appetite of European negotiators for a tough deal. It is highly unlikely that we will emerge with anything other than broadly the same arrangements, but without a voice in Europe. Politicians will get the blame for having deluded voters as to what could be achieved – turning public opinion against the ‘Leave’ camp.<br/>There never was a more poisoned chalice for an incoming Prime Minister. Absent a General Election, the best negotiating position seems to be to play for time. Time to see how the economy, the housing market, the commercial property market and the banking sector develop. Time to assess the extent of Bremorse. Time to develop a Brexit negotiating team, and a plan. Time to let events play out and, frankly, hope for a ‘Get Out of Jail Free’ card.<br/>The recent robust performance of our portfolios has been dominated by exposure to foreign currency-denominated assets, whose values have appreciated in proportion to the decline in Sterling. The focus on potential Sterling weakness was a conscious decision on our part, made easier by a series of increasingly<br/>weak UK economic data before the referendum. Our holdings in gold, alternatives and US government bonds also helped. These positions offset the initial decline in the levels of most stockmarkets, although then rallied to pre-referendum highs.<br/>Looking forwards, we walk a difficult line between the role of foreign currencies as a<br/>safe haven and the potential for a good Brexit outcome to boost Sterling. I would characterise the path of our portfolios as being driven more by politics, rather than economics or markets, than at any time in their history.<br/>The quick resolution of the Conservative leadership contest removed one source of political uncertainty and delay, but a ‘good Brexit’ is still by no means assured. Political developments will continue to have a bearing on our positioning, especially in currencies. Meanwhile, any economic impact is likely<br/>to be centred on the UK and, to a lesser extent, continental Europe. Therefore we<br/>have repositioned our stockmarket holdings tactically away from the UK and Europe, and towards the US, while maintaining a significant investment in Asia. We feel confident that<br/>the US economy is on a sound footing and economic growth there is likely to surprise to the upside. This makes it possible for US profits to get back on track after 18 months in the<br/>doldrums, and an increase in US economic activity is generally good for larger Asian companies too. The US stockmarket is not cheap in aggregate, but our value strategy puts an emphasis on stocks trading at more attractive valuations, where we see better medium-term prospects.<br/>So while currencies are working well at the moment as a risk management device, we also hope to find more alternatives that can help preserve capital in a wide range of market conditions.<br/>Seven Investment Management LLP is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.

We work closely with some of the most respected names in the fund management industry to offer a range of multi asset funds, model portfolios and a unique discretionary portfolio service. All of our solutions are guided by the core principles of our investment process and philosophy, allowing advisers to recommend solutions for their clients that will deliver in line with agreed client expectations.<br/>Liontrust, one of the leading names in fund management, were recently appointed to run the mandate for the entire FP Verbatim Growth Fund Range following their success in running portfolios FP Verbatim 4 and<br/>FP Verbatim 6. Below, we hear from John Husselbee, fund manager, on the processes they apply in running client money.<br/>Our Multi-Manager Multi-Asset process<br/>at Liontrust has risk at its core, with every portfolio run within volatility bands and targeting a return appropriate to those bands. Employed on FP Verbatim Growth fund range since 1st July 2016, the process is designed<br/>to achieve two main objectives. The first is<br/>to target the outcome expected by investors in terms of risk, as measured by volatility, which enables them to select an appropriate portfolio; the second is to maximise the return for each level of risk.<br/>While returns will always depend on movements in underlying markets, the strict<br/>volatility bands on our portfolios are designed to ensure more consistent outcomes for investors.<br/>There are four stages to our process,<br/>strategic asset allocation (SAA), tactical asset allocation (TAA), fund selection and portfolio construction. Risk management is central to each of these stages and the portfolios are designed to provide diversification across asset classes, geographical regions and investment style in order to enhance the risk- adjusted returns.<br/>As stated, all of our portfolios have a distinct risk profile, expressed in terms of target volatility.<br/>Each year, we collate and analyse historical returns and volatilities of a range of asset classes, as well as their correlations with<br/>each other, to determine the strategic asset allocation that should meet the volatility targets for each portfolio over the long-term. When building the SAA, we assume the historic characteristics of different asset classes provide a reasonable guide to their future behaviour.<br/>This is essentially the default asset allocation should we have no views on the relative attractiveness of different asset classes. Of course, we do have views on relative value and these will influence the tactical asset allocation stage, increasing exposure when assets look cheap and reducing it when they appear expensive.<br/>To work out tactical tilts, (see Fig.1) we first rate the overall investment environment<br/>– taking into account valuation levels and investor sentiment – rating it, and then each asset, from one to five. We review several factors in determining our scores, such as<br/>the macroeconomic environment (growth, interest rates, inflation), where we are in the business cycle and valuations (both absolute and relative). We may also use technical analysis to help understand short-term market movements to aid the short-term timing of such decisions including moving averages, RSI, and bull/bear ratios.<br/>","25<br/>Strategic Assset Allocation Current Assset Allocation<br/>1 Year<br/>5.16%<br/>3 Year*<br/>16.61%<br/>5 Year<br/>32.40%<br/>Front 1st day of trading<br/>40.76%<br/>1 Year<br/>1.52%<br/>3 Year*<br/>15.55%<br/>5 Year<br/>28.11%<br/>Front 1st day of trading<br/>50.05%<br/>We believe in backing our asset allocation policy with conviction.<br/>We believe in backing our asset allocation policy with conviction and when mandated an unconstrained portfolio, it is not uncommon to see a zero weighting in unfavoured asset classes or regions.<br/>relevant as a smaller number of discretionary and wealth managers control an ever larger proportion of assets in the retail market.

Our analysis has shown that many funds with headline- grabbing cumulative returns have been remarkably inconsistent when analysed on a discrete basis. Often, one period of extreme outperformance can mask subsequent longer- term underperformance, so we will never look at cumulative performance in isolation. For us, the key elements that should underpin fund selection are investment process, plus manager experience, knowledge and remuneration.<br/>Our selection process incorporates quantitative and qualitative analysis. The quantitative allows us to highlight attractive opportunities in the investment universe of approximately 5,000 funds, with the aim to identify managers with a process that consistently outperforms an appropriate benchmark.We are looking to establish if a fund’s return has been generated by genuine manager skill or if it is more down to chance, and if the manager is consistent in the application of his or her process.<br/>Having passed through the quantitative process, the funds are then subject to a qualitative review that looks at additional characteristics and risks and typically involves us meeting the managers.<br/>Key factors include the size of a fund and<br/>how much it has recently enjoyed inflows or suffered outflows. This is becoming increasingly<br/>Style – and style drift – is another part of our analysis and can be particularly important considering the strict volatility bands on the portfolios. We select funds and managers that complement each other in terms of style, so it is key they maintain their approach and do not drift away from it. If they do, this is a reason for us to sell out of a fund.<br/>A large part of our work is identifying key personnel who have historically contributed to a fund’s performance and we always meet individuals who are likely to have a material<br/>impact on future returns – we conduct more than 200 detailed one-to-one manager meetings each year.<br/>We are keen to understand the motivations of a fund’s key contributors. This includes the remuneration of fund managers but we also evaluate changes in the contentment and commitment of managers, which can be a warning signal of a future deterioration in performance.<br/>Source - FE ANAYSIST<br/>* Userdefinedperformance30/06/2013to30/062016Overall ** User defined performance 01/03/2010 to 30/06/2016 Overall<br/>Disclaimer:<br/>The views expressed are correct only at the time of publication and<br/>are subject to change.

In the analysis available to advisers, the stochastic model will only work where a conventional asset allocation exists.<br/>Most absolute return funds’ risk and return profiles conform to the Moody’s ‘Hedge’ category, of which they form a sub set. However, there is greater diversity within the sector than most, and this needs to be examined. Accuracy can also be lacking within the data feeds – some have no asset allocation data, some are registered as alternative and some attempt to represent asset allocations in a manner that is probably not reliable. Standard Life GARS for example is registered in the F.E. feed as mainly global bonds, but scrutiny of the underlining strategies shows this to be loose approximation at best.<br/>A lack of consistency may mean that some of these funds may not be recommendable by an adviser, unless a very high risk assessment is attributed. A good example of the unpredictable nature of one of these is the City Financial Absolute Equity Fund. It is the best performing fund in its sector over 3 to 5 years which is barnstorming. But for several months up to August it nosedived, dropping 25% in 6 months. That is a spectacular drawdown.<br/>However, to advise on such a fund, there is some analysis that can help, and that will form the basis of due diligence if required. We focus on the ‘distribution of returns’. This involves measuring the consistency<br/>of the returns (long tail versus peak – see graph), equating this to the consistency of the performance of the fund. It is the same as looking at the ‘Kurtosis’ value, which you can look up in Synaptic Fund Research. For example, if you wish to take risk out of your UK asset allocation, you could legitimately use Henderson UK Absolute Return, as the shape of returns mirror the UK sector, but the distribution of returns (and returns themselves) are muted as a result of the (hedging) strategies employed.<br/>The above is an example of a grid that you can create within the Synaptic Fund Research tool, which allows you to examine some of the attributes of absolute return funds:<br/>Our first graph confirms the success that some absolute return funds have had in managing risk and return historically.<br/>The second graph maps the distribution of returns – and evidences consistency in management styles.<br/>Synaptic Product and Fund Research is part of the Synaptic Research suite – call 0800 783 4477 for more information including our ‘Suitability’ promotional deal.<br/>","30<br/>What does the recent Thematic Review Paper on suitability tell us about platform due diligence?<br/>Although it doesn’t grab the headlines to the extent it used to, the subject of platforms within the context of compliance is still very much alive.<br/>The adoption of investment platforms has influenced the evolution of financial advice more than anything else, and continues to do so. Online access to platforms heralded the wrap revolution, where full control of clients’ assets could be assumed by advisers.<br/>The long anticipated ban on commissions was no big deal as ‘adviser charging’ was facilitated by the platforms. In fact Synaptic and other published data suggest that in some cases, advisers are charging more ‘ad valorem’ in<br/>the current AUM gathering culture than they did through the old provider products.<br/>The full wrap functionality that many take for granted today is just another stop on this frenetic technological journey. Further down the line, advisers who are not clear about the value that they represent to their clients and how they evolve their business models will suffer. The ability to provide custody<br/>to investments, to offer proven bargain basement price asset allocation strategies and managed solutions will be ubiquitous, forcing even the fittest to adapt to survive. The advisers who see themselves as ‘wealth managers’ may go the way of dinosaurs if they are only focussed on the accumulation of assets. They need to be monetising the aspects of their expertise that are valued by clients, the financial coaching, the planning and the problem solving.<br/>But where we are today with platforms does present a potential conflict of interest; one that has been specifically highlighted in<br/>the recent Thematic Review Paper TR16/1, and one that rounds up concerns identified by the regulator over some years. Taking advantage of the full wrap functionality offered by the best platform solutions brings its own risks, and though the regulator may be ‘extremely concerned’, there is nothing a bit of sensible due diligence using Synaptic tools cannot put right.<br/>TR16/1 is succinct. It states:<br/>‘the poor quality of an advisory firm’s research and due diligence is one of the three root causes for poor consumer outcomes. The other two are incorrect risk profiling and costs.’<br/>We deal with risk profiling elsewhere in this edition, but we would offer another perspective from the paper which is the<br/>regulator’s concern with the use of platforms – where the ‘service’ element that benefits advisers and the way they manage their businesses can appear to override the best interests of customers:<br/>‘Many firms demonstrated inconsistent and insufficient research and due diligence in the selection of platforms’.<br/>The way to bat away this concern is to provide sufficient research to evidence suitability at the client level – which means ideally performing client specific research, and crucially not over relying on a platform’s own tools, where a wider market perspective cannot be achieved. A wrap creates its own financial ecosystem, and without care, may appear to constrain an independent adviser.<br/>The full wrap functionality that many take for granted today is just another stop on this frenetic technological journey. Further down the line, advisers who are not clear about the value that they represent to their clients and how they evolve their business models will suffer.<br/>","31<br/>Illustration results (source Synaptic Comparator).

We meet some firms who resist due diligence. They assess platforms according to the usual criteria (stuff that you can tick off on a list) – financial strength of parent, terms and conditions, range of funds and tax wrappers, functionality, accessibility – and when it comes to cost, they look at the headline costs, such as the generic charge of the platform and fund TERs, failing to capture the nuances of charges that exist. The first element is the relatively easy part of the due diligence which can be summarised on a single Synaptic Research grid along the lines of:<br/>What advisers don’t always do is look at cost at an individual case level, taking into account the specific fund or portfolio selection they<br/>are recommending, or look to understand how the myriad of different combinations involving platform, wrapper and fund work. Those who haven’t performed this research may be surprised to know the extent of these variations in cost.<br/>Of course advisers shouldn’t be chasing minute increments of savings, but they should be able to perform Reduction in Yield calculations that can confirm the value that they are delivering. Working to keep the costs down for the client puts additional income in the adviser’s pocket. Our illustration is based on a £50k ISA transfer.<br/>Our illustration shows that on any case,<br/>the difference between two premier league platforms can be significant - in this case several thousand pounds of avoidable charges. The point is to understand these variations as they are unpredictable and varied.<br/>If your platform due diligence is generic and stops at platform level, you cannot accurately evidence the quality of the advice you impart to clients.<br/>For more information about the Synaptic Research Suite, please visit www.synaptic.co.uk or call us on 0800 783 4477.<br/>","32<br/>Investment risk – the challenge for advisers<br/>Eric Armstrong | Product Marketing | Synaptic Software Limited<br/>The principles-based regulatory system that we have in the UK means that there is no prescription or right or wrong in how to operate at a risk level, only guidance and descriptions of good and poor practice. What IS obligatory is that the adviser can demonstrate that he or she knows their client and understands their objectives, as well as their tolerance and capacity for loss. This is set out in the 2011 paper ‘Assessing suitability’. Operating effectively around risk can be phenomenally complex, especially when you are trying to design an advice process that can be replicated across a group of advisers.<br/>The central problem is that risk is subjective, allied with the fact that the markets and therefore investment returns are unpredictable. Advisers must evidence suitability none-the- less - something that many firms are falling short of today. The recent follow-up paper,<br/>the Thematic Review TR16/1, spells this out in respect of risk profiling:<br/>‘the poor quality of an advisory firm’s research and due diligence is one of the three root causes for poor consumer outcomes. The other two are incorrect risk profiling and costs.’<br/>The importance of an effective risk framework underpinning your investment strategy<br/>We believe the best approach is to take the (Moody’s) stochastic route. This takes a<br/>model based on assumptions (about markets, interest rates, inflation and so on) and then runs mathematical simulations – which provide a probability based model for the full range of outcomes. Working back, you can then plan for worst and best case scenarios, as well as ‘the most likely’. The key advantage of this approach is that the view of the future is something you can present to clients – offering a ‘framework’ for decisions based on quantified possible outcomes.<br/>There is a lot of negativity about (ATR) questionnaires – but they perform the invaluable function of anchoring your client into a relative framework, meaning that your perspective on your clients’ attitude<br/>to risk can be benchmarked against a wider population. The questions also mean that you as an adviser can efficiently cover off an in depth discussion around risk, especially<br/>the dynamics of risk and return, as you are required to by the regulator. It provides a context for the ‘conversation’ as people often refer to it as, and in no way constrains the adviser. It is hard to imagine a more effective alternative.<br/>In the Synaptic approach, the ATRQ aligns with 5 different Risk Categories, and because it is a probability based model, a mathematically derived value known as the ‘Minimum gain’* is produced – a bit like drawdown. The ‘Minimum gain’ is expressed as a percentage probability, of the extent of loss ascribed to the worst year in 20 years of expected returns. Equipped with this value, you are able to frame the all-important ‘Capacity for Loss’ discussion, on which the regulatory approach is built. This is how to turn risk into an objective discussion.<br/>","33<br/>The central problem is that risk is subjective, allied with the fact that the markets and therefore investment returns are unpredictable.<br/>A snapshot of the Moody’s Risk Framework:<br/>Strategic Asset Allocation<br/>Classes<br/>Min Gain*<br/>Average Gain<br/>Max Gain<br/>Cautious<br/>Cash 50.00%<br/>UK Corporate Bonds 29.00% UK Equities 8.00%<br/>Global Equities (ex UK) 7.00% Global Property 6.00%<br/>-5.26%<br/>4.99%<br/>15.27%<br/>Moderately Cautious<br/>UK Corporate Bonds 55.00% UK Equities 15.00%<br/>Global Equities (ex UK) 14.00% Global Property 12.00%<br/>Cash 4.00%<br/>-10.73%<br/>6.14%<br/>22.70%<br/>Balanced<br/>UK Corporate Bonds 36.00% Global Equities (ex UK) 30.00% UK Equities 20.00%<br/>Global Property 9.00%<br/>Emerging Markets Equities 5.00%<br/>-15.28%<br/>7.08%<br/>28.27%<br/>Moderately Adventurous<br/>Global Equities (ex UK) 43.00%<br/>UK Equities 24.00%<br/>UK Corporate Bonds 20.00%<br/>Emerging Markets Equities 7.00%<br/>Global Property 6.00%<br/>-18.50%<br/>7.71%<br/>33.01%<br/>Adventurous<br/>Global Equities (ex UK) 61.00% UK Equities 29.00%<br/>Emerging Markets Equities 10.00%<br/>-24.21%<br/>8.56%<br/>40.85%<br/>Review of the historical accuracy of a model such as Moody’s is something that can be done in retrospect.

You should consult Royal London directly for further information<br/>before recommending.<br/>About the service: Synaptic Risk Ratings are worked out by analysing the underlying asset classes within the fund or portfolio. Synaptic Software have requested asset allocation information from participating providers in a specific format aligned to the risk framework of the system. These asset classes are used by the model to determine the risk rating, a process that may result in a level of approximation though in most cases this will be insignificant. It is also possible that certain asset classes may not be represented exactly in the manner that providers would prefer.<br/>Reasonable endeavours are made to provide accuracy and consistency, however neither participating providers nor Synaptic Software can be held responsible for any errors or omissions. No recommendation should be made solely on the basis of the Synaptic Risk Ratings, and additional research should be undertaken for any case.

It also gives us<br/>a snapshot of what clients are currently doing and the chance to monitor trends over time.<br/>General information<br/>The average fund size among Royal London drawdown plans is £75,000. A third of plans are currently paying out regular income,<br/>of which the majority (72%) are in capped drawdown and the remainder in Flexi-Access Drawdown (FAD).<br/>Income levels<br/>Average withdrawals<br/>The average level of income being withdrawn is 11%, however the median is 7% indicating a greater variation amongst those who are taking higher levels of withdrawal, as might be expected in an environment where there are no income limits.<br/>This is borne out by a comparison between FAD plans, where the difference between average and median is 12% (21% and 9% respectively), and capped drawdown where the trend is actually the other way but much less significant (6% and 7%).<br/>The fact that there are more people taking lower levels of withdrawal is positive, however the median of 7% is probably too high to be sustainable for life unless other sources of income are forthcoming at a later date.<br/>Sustainability<br/>According to our stochastic modelling the majority (54%) of RL drawdown plans where regular income is being taken have less<br/>than a 1 in 5 chance of sustaining current income levels for life. Taken in isolation this is extremely concerning, and may suggest that our customers are either underestimating how long they will need income for, or have no way of translating this into a sustainable figure.<br/>It must be emphasized however that these figures do not take into account the client’s actual objectives. Now that the DGS is live, advisers will have a chance to make changes to the parameters used for assessment.<br/>Some clients may be deliberately running down the value of one pension in the knowledge that others exist, others may have started out taking a higher level of income which they already intend to reduce. Results over the next few quarters will therefore be interesting.<br/>Happily, the next most popular group contains those who have the greatest chance of sustainable lifetime income, which is a definite indication that the issue of sustainability is being discussed and acted upon.<br/>Contributions<br/>Of course sustainability is not just about what’s being taken out, but also what is being put in. Unfortunately very few plans – only 11% - are still being topped up, although of course under the freedom rules they could be, regardless of age or earnings.<br/>Investments<br/>Of specific interest to Royal London is the increasing use of our Governed Retirement Income Portfolios (GRIPs) with regular withdrawal plans. Overall the 20% of income policies are invested in GRIPs, however this has increased to 48% among new plans set up since the freedoms were introduced in April 2015.<br/>In September we will revisit these figures to see what has changed and how plans are performing against their individual income targets.<br/>Further information<br/>Visit adviser.royallondon.com/pensions.<br/>","43<br/>Life begins at...<br/>Fiona Holmes | Proposition Communications Manager | Royal London<br/>Having reached a certain age (it’s the new 40 by the way), I’m having to come to terms with the fact that my peers and I aren’t as immune from illness or death as we’d like to think.<br/>That’s the problem with 30 being the new<br/>20 and 40 the new 30, when you reach your 50’s and you’ve gone through life relatively unscathed, you really start to think you’re invincible. But then things happen around you and you realise that’s not quite the case.<br/>At the risk of sounding like my mother-in-law whose main topic of conversation is illness, death and funerals, in the space of six months an old University friend died from cancer, another friend was diagnosed with terminal cancer and a good friend has just been diagnosed with breast cancer.<br/>While my immediate thoughts are with those friends and their families, I can’t help but think I’m glad I held onto my critical illness policy.<br/>Working in the protection industry I’m only too aware of the need for cover should the worst happen but there have been times over the years when I’ve toyed with the idea of cancelling it. It’s the usual ‘it won’t happen<br/>to me’ scenario. But I never thought it would happen to those friends and it has.<br/>A few weeks ago my friend with breast cancer was lying on a beach in Thailand without a care in the world. Next week she’ll undergo a mastectomy and breast reconstruction and will endure at least four months of treatment. This is life changing stuff and something neither she nor her family were prepared for.<br/>I hope she’ll be fine financially, but emotionally it’s hard to say how she will cope. According to Macmillan Cancer Support, 45% of people with cancer say the emotional effects of the illness are the most difficult<br/>to cope with, compared to the physical and practical aspects.1<br/>It’s statistics like those that make you realise just how important added value services<br/>like Royal London’s Helping Hand are. In<br/>our experience the emotional and practical support a customer received through Helping Hand has often been more of a lifeline than their actual pay out.<br/>While improvements in cancer treatment mean more people are surviving or living longer following their illness, all too often, the stress of managing everyday life following diagnosis and treatment is huge with the psychological and emotional impact continuing long after the cancer itself is treated.<br/>The number of people living with cancer in<br/>the UK is increasing by 3.2% every year. If<br/>this rate continues this could see four million people living with cancer by 2030.2 Cuts in NHS spending, lack of aftercare service and the psychological impact of being diagnosed with a critical illness all bring with them a need for added value services like Helping Hand.<br/>So as I embrace my half century – and no, it isn’t all about varifocals and cruise ships – I hope I’ll never have to make a claim on my critical illness cover. But knowing it’s there with additional support services that I could call on if needed, gives me peace of mind. After all, we never know what life’s going to throw at us.<br/>1 Worried Sick: The Emotional Impact of Cancer.

Things happen slowly and there has been little<br/>true innovation in the market with many providers and distributors offering similar customer journeys and products with little<br/>to differentiate them.Whilst there is some innovation on the front line where distributors are facing off to customers, providers (and reinsurers) are slow to innovate.<br/>It’s a comfortable, stable industry with many of us in very comfortable, stable jobs. The industry is filled with barriers to innovation such as systems legacy issues and large inforce portfolios that can constrain genuine creative innovation for new business. The market remains flat and yet we keep hoping for it to grow. As Einstein was quoted, the definition of insanity is ‘doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results’.<br/>Our ‘Expanding the Reach of Protection<br/>Seminar’ set out to challenge the status quo and look for ways to grow the market for the benefit of everyone.<br/>Where is the innovation going to come from? During the seminar we surveyed the delegates and asked them who they thought had the greatest responsibility to lead innovation in the market. The overwhelming response was providers.We then asked the delegates who they thought in reality was most likely to lead innovation in the future. The responses were very different, with the two groups felt most<br/>likely to lead innovation being the Distributors and FinTech companies. There is a danger that we’re all sitting here waiting for somebody else to act and we’ll end up being in exactly the same position 10 years from now.<br/>Behavioural Economics shows us that we have a natural tendency to have a herd like mentality. It takes a brave soul to distance themselves from the crowd.We keep talking about change and expecting the rise in direct<br/>to consumer and more digital innovation, but it doesn’t really happen. This is all in a backdrop of fairly poor financial capability amongst consumers. A survey conducted by The Money Advice Service found that 4 in 10 people wouldn’t have the means to cope with an unexpected bill of £300 and only 5 in 10 have financial goals.<br/>What works well in current distribution models?<br/>We often talk in the industry about the need to stimulate demand but how true is this? Our distribution session heard the thoughts of experts from companies with three very different distribution models: Andy Walton (Intrinsic), John Nelmes (Cavendish) and Mark Jones (Sunlife). Whilst our three wise men might disagree with how best to engage with customers, all three painted a positive picture for demand in the UK and all felt<br/>that there are opportunities to grow their respective models. Between 2012 and 2014, the number of people searching for the words ‘Life Insurance’ on Google doubled, but yet we certainly haven’t seen an uptick in sales of that magnitude. Why is this and what can we do about it?<br/>As an industry we can be pretty poor at engaging customers and using a language that makes our products accessible to them.<br/>We talk about the Protection industry and<br/>Behavioural Economics shows us that we have a natural tendency to have a herd like mentality. It takes a brave soul to distance themselves from the crowd.<br/>","45<br/>The industry is filled with barriers to innovation such as systems legacy issues and large inforce portfolios that can constrain genuine creative innovation for new business.<br/>the Protection gap – ask most customers<br/>what they think Protection means and they’ll probably suggest sunscreen, bodyguards or contraceptives. We need to shift the language we use – stop talking about products and<br/>start talking about outcomes. What is it that customers actually want? They want to know that should they die, that their loved ones<br/>will have enough money to live on after their death. They want to know that should they get ill, that they will be able to stay in their homes. We should take a huge pride in our industry that we can do this for people and make sure that we don’t confuse them in a fog of jargon.<br/>The future - a call for action<br/>So what does the future hold? Our safe, comfortable industry could start to be invaded from the outside. Given the lack of innovation from within the industry, who is to stop the likes of a Google coming in and shaking things up? With the rise of Wearables and the gizmos and gadgets that can be attached to our smartphones to monitor blood glucose levels, blood pressure, heart rate as well as others, there is plenty of opportunity to use all this data to offer the young and healthy, cheap, easy, affordable life insurance that really meets customer needs and adapts and grows with them.<br/>Most efforts to digitalise our industry to date have been to start to collect email addresses from customers so that we can save the cost of a stamp when trying to communicate with them. Whilst this is not a bad aim, actually many of us simply ignore our emails as easily as we do a piece of marketing material that comes through the front door. The next generation who are coming through are more likely to be found reading their Instagram or Twitter feed than their emails so we need<br/>to find better and more diverse ways of communicating with the next generation<br/>We also risk our industry imploding from the inside. The relentless pursuit of pricing for the healthiest individuals naturally leads to increases in price for others.<br/>Making cover more expensive for those who can arguably least afford it can only have<br/>one impact – to shrink the market. This was precisely the experience in the US when it moved to preferred pricing and we risk it happening here too, with ever more rating factors being applied to the cover that we provide. It’s an often held view that insurers only offer cover to those who don’t really need it. Whilst of course we need to protect ourselves against fraudulent or ‘certain’ claims, we do need to remember that insurance is supposed to be about a ‘pooling’ of risk and the more we sub-divide those pools, the more we reinforce this view.<br/>So what were the key takeaways from the seminar? To me, they were:<br/>1. Demand is out there.<br/>2. Recognise the need to test and learn.<br/>3. Keeppacewiththewaytheworld communicates.<br/>Over 90% of the delegates who responded to our survey after the seminar said that they would do something differently as a result which feels like precisely what our industry needs.<br/>The relentless pursuit of pricing for the healthiest individuals naturally leads to increases in price for others.<br/>*Reflections from the SCOR Seminar, Wednesday 10th February 2016<br/>","Looking for an expert in business protection?

Numbers that pass you by because you’re absorbed in the detail of something else.<br/>The details that people like me obsess over are nuances like:<br/>• straight through processing rates – trying to get 80% of people insured immediately rather than 75%<br/>• underwriting quality – trying to reduce errors made from 2% to 1.5%<br/>• claims payout rates – trying to increase claims paid from 97% to 98%<br/>By getting details like this right the hope is that the ongoing decline in protection sales can be reversed. If we build a slightly better process to go with a slightly better product things should get slightly better – or so we delude ourselves.<br/>By the last talk of a conference my mind drifts to those details – particularly when a speaker straight bats back an answer to a question “what mark would you give the protection industry out of 10 at the moment” with a middle of the road “I’d give it a 6 out of 10”. Never mind that the opinion was that of Mail<br/>On Sunday’s Financial Editor Jeff Prestridge – I confess to breathing a sigh of relief and getting back to thinking of other things.<br/>Because 6 out of 10 is OK, right? 60% is a good pass in most exams. In Jeff’s newspaper terms it’s an OK performance by a footballer or a decent album by a band. Not many people lose their jobs for delivering a 6 out of 10 performance every day of the week.<br/>And there’s the rub. The challenge – how do we motivate ourselves to do better than OK? How can we motivate ourselves to be worried and angry when we hear all of our hard work given a 6 out of 10 rather than being slightly relieved?<br/>6 out of 10 doesn’t keep the leaders of our industry awake at night. It doesn’t cause multinationals to invest heavily to change performance. It doesn’t cause the regulator to get their magnifying glass on what we’re up to. It is hard to force yourself to move from being OK to risking being great.<br/>Many of the things that enable you to be OK stop you being great. The safety-first culture, the risk-averse decisions, the committee group- think, all limit our likely range of outcomes to a 5-7 out of 10.<br/>Compare this with start ups, where a more individualistic streak is at play. Companies and micro industries may rate as 9 out of 10 or 2 out of 10, many will fail but some will succeed.<br/>Stories not statistics – emotion not education need to be at the forefront of our work.<br/>o<br/>","ours<br/>49<br/>Working in a 9 out of 10 industry sounds something to work together to aim for. But it needs us all to get scared today to not settle for OK tomorrow.<br/>Ultimately a 3* review for a movie or album is likely to mean that existing fans of the director or band will buy it (and be happy with their purchase) but it is unlikely to get people who aren’t currently fans to go and see it.<br/>The exceptions probably occur when there’s<br/>a massive marketing campaign or when your partner bullies you into it – neither of which is likely to happen with Protection soon.<br/>Insurers must wake up to the risk of not doing anything – or not doing enough. Fintech currently struggles to meet the challenge posed by life insurance. There are easier pickings in general insurance and even investments and pensions that catch the eye. But this new approach, supported by new technology, will come – and when it does it will be quick, and some of those companies will be operating at 9 out of 10 levels.<br/>So how do we change? How do we get urgency into those who are not fearful and who are not inspired and motivated to really make change happen?<br/>• Emotionally engage with the customer, don’t educate them. A sentiment I totally agree with, distilled by Helen White of MAS / ABI at the Protection Review conference. I hate education. To wish or even lobby for education is improbable,<br/>paternalistic and patronising. Too often it enables us to continue to justify building complexity and confusion into products and processes.<br/>We shouldn’t educate the customer about why we are right and they are wrong – why we know more than they do about what<br/>is best for them. Stories not statistics – emotion not education need to be at the forefront of our work. Like it or not we need to recognise the “post-facts, anti experts” world that Brexit encapsulates and learn from the successful techniques of this and other campaigns.<br/>• Deliver targeted process improvements<br/>at clear groups of people. For all the self- loathing, well over a million people a year start a new protection policy. One size doesn’t fit all. Get bespoke – 10% of the existing market is a serious number and you may even grow it whilst you’re there. Whether you focus on the healthy young lives who haven’t engaged with protection before, the lives who have been declined by others, or the new business owners, get focused and make your whole journey relevant to them.<br/>• On the front line selling protection is a seriously competitive marketplace, with much more variance between companies<br/>– there are some 9s and some 2s out there in terms of both quality and quantity of protection sales. Insurers are desperate to work with sales channels that are hungry to sell protection the right way. If you have or want to build something that you’re proud of in the protection space, let those companies know and let them show you how hungry they can be to help boost your training, sales materials, processes and ultimately financials.<br/>If we do each of these well then I would be prepared to argue with anyone who gives us<br/>a 6 out of 10 review in the future. I think the shift in results if we achieved these aims could earn an extra point for each of these truly delivered. Working in a 9 out of 10 industry sounds something to work together to aim for. But it needs us all to get scared today to not settle for OK tomorrow.<br/>COVER ME NOW<br/>","50<br/>A £200billion opportunity<br/>Ron Wheatcroft | Technical Manager | Swiss Re<br/>The UK falls behind the rest of Europe when it comes to its citizens being protected against the financial consequences of prolonged disability. Swiss Re reported in 2015 that the UK has a Disability Protection Gap totalling £200billion p.a., the largest shortfall in any European country.<br/>Many people continue to assume that their employer or the State, will provide for them. Some indications that people are gradually getting the message that the State is withdrawing have not translated into taking any action with new IP sales in 2015 just over100,000, being just 9% of new term life and critical illness policies. The number of in-force IP policies has declined by more than 20% since 2006.<br/>Although the number of people insured under employer-sponsored arrangements rose by 20% over the same period, the number of insured schemes is falling. We have seen a<br/>trend towards shorter benefit payment periods, both through new individual IP product options and, in the employer-sponsored market, the gradual reduction in benefit payment periods to a maximum payment period, typically no more than five years.<br/>Overall, no more people are covered than in 2006, at best, around 20% of the UK workforce either on an insured basis or where their employer chooses to self-insure.<br/>Of the new individual IP policies, 35% only pay for a limited period rather than through to expected retirement age, giving people<br/>breathing space to adapt their finances to changed circumstances rather than addressing the longer-term need. What happens when benefits come to an end? Presumably people are happy to rely on their savings to see them through if, indeed, they think that far ahead. What about the other 80%, including self- employed people, with no cover at all.<br/>Purchasing income protection and selecting the appropriate level of coverage without advice or guidance is not simple - even<br/>if people have every intention to do so. Consumer research carried out by Swiss Re identifies perceived product complexity as a big factor determining whether consumers feel sufficiently confident to purchase products or services without advice.<br/>Maintaining income is a classic area where quality advice adds real value. Going alone is not easy - a Google search brings up a mixture of products protecting against the financial consequences of redundancy or unemployment as well as IP.<br/>Although the number of people insured under employer-sponsored arrangements rose by 20% over the same period, the number of insured schemes is falling.<br/>","51<br/>Purchasing income protection and selecting the appropriate level of coverage without advice or guidance is not simple - even if people have every intention to do so.<br/>Existing employer provision is, of course, a vital consideration when looking at need. There is a strong case for annual benefit statements to reinforce the cover that the employer has arranged. So often, our research shows people overestimating what their employer will provide.<br/>Advisers can help people to understand their likely entitlement to State Benefits since, depending on their circumstances, private cover could simply replace benefits which would have been paid by the State. Deepening welfare budget cuts could mean that State Benefits become negligible or non-existent when disability occurs.<br/>It’s a sobering thought that work on a suite<br/>of simple protection products, led by HM Treasury, began more than five years ago yet we still remain a very long way away from an income protection product which consumers could buy directly with any confidence. This<br/>is primarily down to the complex relationship between private and State Benefits. Universal credit, based on the household rather than the individual, makes it even harder to quantify the need for cover.<br/>Protecting long-term income is one of the most fundamental financial needs people have, arguably more important than saving for a<br/>pension since, without income, other desired financial behaviours simply can’t happen.<br/>While this is a classic advice opportunity, new ways to access the market will be essential<br/>if fewer customers have access to advice about their protection needs in the future, or just choose to purchase directly in the same way that they make other purchases. This might include a bigger role for employers as facilitators and raising awareness through workplace education rather than necessarily as providers.<br/>Simple steps to aid consumer understanding will make people more aware of the financial consequences of prolonged disability and what to do to protect against them. The Money Advice Service work on financial capability highlights just how far we have to go to help make people more resilient to life’s shocks.<br/>7 Families shows how powerful real case studies can be in presenting a compelling case: the material has led to increased intermediary sales. Levels of financial literacy are low yet, historically, the industry way of delivering messages has often been through statistics setting out the chances of prolonged disability and claims paid rates. These are useful but purchasing IP is, for most people, an emotional decision rather than one based on statistical analysis.<br/>While the choice as to whether to advise on income replacement needs is ultimately a commercial decision for intermediaries, that £200billion figure represents a real opportunity to build on and grow customer relationships.<br/>Simple steps to<br/>aid consumer understanding will make people more aware of the financial consequences of prolonged disability and what to do to protect against them.<br/>","52<br/>Overcoming the ‘indifference’ challenge by harnessing the best of human and artificial intelligence<br/>Justin Harper | Head of Marketing & Industry Relations | LV=<br/>The UK is vastly underinsured; most people find it difficult to understand and appreciate the everyday risks that they face – and are ignorant to the consequences and implications of those risks happening. When presented with the idea of financial protection a common brick wall reaction is ‘it won’t happen to me.’<br/>Many advisers we’ve spoken with have said that they struggle to handle and overcome this objection; they find it difficult to ‘quantify’ the risks and get clients involved at an emotional level.<br/>Whether we like it or not, the old adage remains true ‘protection needs to be sold’. Yet if your client doesn’t understand and buy in to the importance of protection, then they won’t buy into your recommendations.<br/>The rise of all things digital has changed the world we live in. But when it comes to the matters of protection, is technology your friend or your foe?<br/>A trip down memory lane<br/>I cut my protection selling teeth back in the days of the direct sales force - you might remember the likes of Allied Dunbar and the Pru. The 80’s pre-dated FCA and the FSA, and Lautro was just a young baby. Adviser status, commission disclosure and<br/>most certainly RDR were years away. Mobile phones resembled heavy bricks and ‘social media’ meant catching up with your mates down the pub on a Friday night.<br/>Sales training was conducted with flipcharts and ‘gadgets’ such as the Overhead Projector, with training boot camps lasting weeks on end. Advisers ventured out to meet clients armed with rate table books and weighty tomes such as Visual Aid Folders (a big lever arch folder containing a variety of static ideas, concepts and diagrams).<br/>Sale questioning techniques were all the rage - remember SPIN? So too were simple concepts such as the ‘money making machine’ and ‘four boxes’. But the trusted friend of many a salesperson was the freedom of a ‘blank sheet of paper’.<br/>Whilst the days of yore weren’t all great, we were schooled in the art of selling. ‘Emotional disturbance’ was encouraged alongside the more rational aspects of<br/>process, fact find forms, calculations and technical detail.<br/>Life was simple, an adviser was often at the centre of the community and insurance was a people business.<br/>Fast forward to the present day<br/>Fast forward 30 years or so to today, and we live in a completely different world. Technology and digital are woven into<br/>the fabric of our everyday lives. Direct<br/>sales forces are few and far between and arranging a mortgage requires many hours of form filling. The likes of Google and comparison sites are the go-to destinations for information and insurance.<br/>More advances are in train with developments in reflexive technology, devices and algorithms all combining to raise the prospects for robo-advice. In fact, the FCA has recently launched a new unit dedicated to these developments.<br/>","53<br/>If your client doesn’t understand and buy in to the importance of protection, then they won’t buy into your recommendations.<br/>Are such advances good or evil? Technology offers speed, consistency and accuracy, but ultimately its power for good, or otherwise, rests in the hands of the user and in its application.<br/>For the open minded pragmatists among us, there are opportunities for combining the best of human ability and the advantages of technology. I share two particular examples that have proven to change minds, influence behaviours and enable advisers to really engage clients in the need for protection.<br/>Triggering the power of emotion<br/>Few people wake up in the morning with a desperate urge to buy protection insurance; it remains a ‘grudge’ purchase. Overcoming ‘it will never happen to me’ through the logical arguments of reeling out incidences and claims stats don’t always cut through. That’s where the power of the human story comes into play.<br/>In the 80’s there was the (in)famous ‘Widow’s Story’; a fictional piece that attempted to highlight the financial and emotional impact of death on those left behind. It was ‘of its time’ and the acting was a little wooden... but many from that era still recall it with fondness.<br/>The most powerful film about protection.... Ever?<br/>Today, film is a common, flexible and accessible medium. An excellent example<br/>of portraying real stories comes from the 7 Families campaign. Sitting at the core of this consumer-focused charity based initiative<br/>are seven real families. All have suffered from life changing illnesses and conditions; all have compelling stories to tell.<br/>The support for the<br/>families under the<br/>campaign is drawing to a<br/>close, yet the films and the initiatives live on. If you haven’t checked them out yet, please do so at www.7families.co.uk. I challenge you or your clients to remain unmoved by the stories told sensitively and powerfully through film - particularly the introduction to Paul and Vicky Pickford.<br/>The best sales aid in the history of mankind?<br/>At LV= we’re passionate about looking<br/>after people financially through their extraordinary journey of life. However, many are oblivious to the risks they face, the importance of financial protection and the real value of professional financial advice.<br/>Through four simple numbers, the LV= Risk Reality Calculator shows the likelihood of your clients being off work for two months or more, suffering a serious illness, or<br/>dying - and importantly the probability of any of these happening - before a chosen retirement age.<br/>In just a matter of seconds, they’ll grasp the importance of protection. The results can kick start an eye opening conversation about what’s really important to them and the real value of financial advice. And the calculator automatically generates a personalised risk report which you can print, email and share.<br/>The simple website design also features support, facts and videos to help your conversation with your client. And because it’s so simple, advisers find it easy to integrate into their advice process; some send it to clients ahead of their meetings, some introduce it at the meeting and others are using to support ongoing protection reviews. You can try it yourself, and with your clients, at www.riskreality.co.uk/gen.<br/>The best of human and artificial intelligence<br/>At LV= we believe in the power of advice and the value of protection.

Take up of Income Protection in the UK is even lower at around 11% (which is low by international standards).<br/>Research commissioned by the ABI has found that 10.6m households representing more than 60% of working families would see their income fall by more than a third, if the main earner had to stop work due to ill health.<br/>We also know the probable impact of a critical illness and death on families.<br/>Some advisers say that protection can take time to write, but others find it a quick and very profitable way to fulfil clients’ needs.
