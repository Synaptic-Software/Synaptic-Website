Our Global Focus approach to ESG    •	 Like all active investment criteria, ESG considerations require judgments about the future.  •	Our judgments about ESG help us get the correct answers to the three questions which       underpin our investment process:  	 • Is the business worth owning…ever?  	 • At what price?  	 • Is the management team working for shareholders?  •	 As with everything we do, our approach to ESG is independent and forward-looking.  •	 ESG is fully integrated into the investment process and is inherent in what we do.    How ESG ratings providers get it wrong    •	 Providers use one-size-fits-all analysis to produce quantification of ESG-friendliness.  •	 Ratings capture what has happened in the past, not how sustainable a business is in the future.  •	 Evaluating ESG factors should not be a standalone exercise.

When Rory Percival                                                                                           published his influential report on Risk Profiling in 2017,                             We are making bold claims, however the development            there were a lot of concerns raised regarding the role                             of Pathways and Risk Explorer is underpinned with             of risk profiling in the modern age, and the reliance on                             extensive user testing and market research in the             ‘tools’. We believe our solution has answered all of these                             changing landscape. MiFID II is uncompromising about          concerns and promoted the role of independent research                             suitability and risk. Our insight was the opportunity         in general. Regulation requires a robust framework,                             to provide the retail advice sector access to the finest      but it is equally important that the experience and                             institutional-grade research and methodology. Most            knowledge of advisers is not eclipsed. A good research                             risk propositions reference Moody’s research into their       tool helps evidence the adviser’s expertise, not dictate                             models, however Risk Explorer is the only tool to provide                             complete access to the Moody’s stochastic engine,                             ensuring that objective, repeatable and reliable risk                             profiling can be performed.                               Similarly, risk ratings tend to include qualitative overlays                             by analysts. In contrast, Synaptic follows Moody’s                             approach of removing these distortions of ‘qualitative                             overlays’, which should remain within the domain of the                             firm, relying instead on the mathematical performance                             attributes of the asset classes under consideration. There                             is no way to maintain objectivity unless quantitative                             and qualitative are both considered.
