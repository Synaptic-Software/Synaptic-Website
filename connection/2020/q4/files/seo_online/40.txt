A new dawn for risk profiling:  introducing Synaptic Risk Explorer    Eric Armstrong             Synaptic is launching a new risk profiling solution                             as part of its Pathways initiative, to introduce a  Client Director            comprehensive financial advice platform. Risk  Synaptic Software Limited  Explorer, the first step on the platform, is designed                             to conquer the challenges of modern compliance                             and establishing suitability.                               We developed the Risk Explorer capabilities to                Synaptic hands off to RSMR for much of the qualitative                             close the gap within existing risk tools available            research accessed through our tool set, whilst owning                             on the market, including access to a full range               the automated, model-driven ‘quant’ analysis for our                             of Synaptic data and MPS portfolios. The                      customers – we think, the best of both worlds.                             Pathways platform will have ongoing releases                             to bring in new capabilities, including removing              Above is one of a series of documents from the regulator                             the need to perform expensive additional                      explaining the central role of suitability in advice.                             MiFID II reporting by automatically delivering                             comprehensive ex-ante and ex-post reports                     What has changed?                             with full disclosure. In this edition, we focus on                             the first feature of Pathways, the Risk Explorer.             Risk has always been a hot potato. When Rory Percival                                                                                           published his influential report on Risk Profiling in 2017,                             We are making bold claims, however the development            there were a lot of concerns raised regarding the role                             of Pathways and Risk Explorer is underpinned with             of risk profiling in the modern age, and the reliance on                             extensive user testing and market research in the             ‘tools’. We believe our solution has answered all of these                             changing landscape. MiFID II is uncompromising about          concerns and promoted the role of independent research                             suitability and risk. Our insight was the opportunity         in general. Regulation requires a robust framework,                             to provide the retail advice sector access to the finest      but it is equally important that the experience and                             institutional-grade research and methodology. Most            knowledge of advisers is not eclipsed. A good research                             risk propositions reference Moody’s research into their       tool helps evidence the adviser’s expertise, not dictate                             models, however Risk Explorer is the only tool to provide                             complete access to the Moody’s stochastic engine,                             ensuring that objective, repeatable and reliable risk                             profiling can be performed.                               Similarly, risk ratings tend to include qualitative overlays                             by analysts. In contrast, Synaptic follows Moody’s                             approach of removing these distortions of ‘qualitative                             overlays’, which should remain within the domain of the                             firm, relying instead on the mathematical performance                             attributes of the asset classes under consideration. There                             is no way to maintain objectivity unless quantitative                             and qualitative are both considered. They are equally                             important of course, but should be treated separately.    40 SYNAPTIC Connection Magazine
