Our Global Focus approach to ESG    •	 Like all active investment criteria, ESG considerations require judgments about the future.  •	Our judgments about ESG help us get the correct answers to the three questions which       underpin our investment process:  	 • Is the business worth owning…ever?  	 • At what price?  	 • Is the management team working for shareholders?  •	 As with everything we do, our approach to ESG is independent and forward-looking.  •	 ESG is fully integrated into the investment process and is inherent in what we do.    How ESG ratings providers get it wrong    •	 Providers use one-size-fits-all analysis to produce quantification of ESG-friendliness.  •	 Ratings capture what has happened in the past, not how sustainable a business is in the future.  •	 Evaluating ESG factors should not be a standalone exercise.
