The recent market dislocation in        Sterling Fixed Income       veteran, who also specialises as a Sterling                   the first quarter really created a great opportunity for        HSBC Global Asset           Corporate bond manager.                                       investors, especially if they allocated at the end of March        Management                                                                                – spreads have retraced somewhat but not to pre-Covid                                    Q. Why should an investor consider                            levels, so there is still value in this market.        Mohamed Siddeeq             buying Sterling Corporates now?        Senior Portfolio Manager                                                                  Also, interest rates are extremely low and are not        HSBC Global Asset           Now is a good time to buy corporate bonds - simply            expected to increase any time soon. Cash rates are        Management                  put, better returns for less risk. Bonds can provide a        close to zero, so on that basis Sterling Corporates are an                                    better risk adjusted return than those of equities. In fact,  attractive asset class on an incremental yield basis.  8                                 Sterling Corporates have outperformed the FTSE 100                                    year-to-date in 2020 on a total return basis, and also        Q. What about allocating to Global                                    over the last 5, 10 and 20-year periods.                      Corporates rather than Sterling                                                                                                  Corporates?                                    Going forward, whilst total returns may be lower than                                    in the past, we could see this relative outperformance        Firstly, whilst many investors may not be aware of this,                                    pattern repeated, as given the pressure that companies        the Sterling Corporate market is global in nature. More                                    are under, equity dividends are uncertain and can be cut      than half of the issuers in this market are international                                    during times of financial weakness. Bond interest is a        companies, and many of the UK issuers are companies                                    more consistent income stream as it is contractually paid     with regional or global footprints (for example one of                                    and senior to dividend income. So in volatile markets,        the largest sterling issuers is EDF - the French energy                                    bonds can be more attractive on a relative return basis       company). Secondly, this broad nature results in a market                                    – locking in returns and helping investors to preserve        that is linked more to global rather than to local news                                    capital.                                                      and risks. Thirdly, the sterling corporate market has                                                                                                  offered historically higher yields and returns than those                                    The available Sterling Corporate bond market universe         found in Euro or US dollar corporate markets.                                    is significant with around £690bn and this is one of the                                    largest bond holdings by UK investors, demonstrating          We believe that HSBC’s strong expertise in credit with                                    that bonds remain a popular allocation. And whilst            a team of over 45 credit analysts based around the                                    popular, Sterling Corporate Bonds is not an asset             globe, has the resources and approach that would likely                                    class that is at the top of the market. Undoubtedly,          add value in a sterling corporate portfolio.
