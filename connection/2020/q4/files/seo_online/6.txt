A question of trust                            I’ve been thinking a lot about trust the past few                          weeks. But first, a story.          Steve Nelson      A few years ago, back when the lang cat was                  Back to the point, Steve        Head of Research  more of a kitten I guess, we put together        the lang cat      an informal list of members of the advice                    Oh yes, so right before thinking about what to write                          community.

Chiefly, it was folk                    our various research exercises conducted recently. A big                          we could lift the phone to and pester every                  chunk of the insight we’ve managed to gather simply                          now and again and vice versa. In truth, these                wouldn’t have been possible had we not built up those                          good people acted as a really important                      relationships over time.
