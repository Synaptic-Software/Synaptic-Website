The Assessing Suitability Review 2 is the FCA’s second evaluation of the market for pensions and investments advice and focuses on the advice that consumers receive around retirement income. On 20th February, the regulator announced that the review will include a focus on initial and ongoing advice to consumers who are taking an income in retirement: ‘Following the pension freedom reforms, we want to assess the outcomes consumers are receiving in this evolving market’. ‘Unsuitable DB to defined contribution (DC) transfers remain a significant source of harm ... we have also identified the potential for significant harm from unsuitable retirement income advice’. The FCA also extended their scope of interest to company schemes, which previously were considered to be outside the focus for consumer protection regulatory activities. So what to think? It seems Suitability really has become the pivot around which everything else moves. It is the cornerstone of the edifice which supports all else - suggesting it should be the most important part of the compliance processes of firms and the area for which, firms should ensure they have a rock-solid approach, employing the best \[Synaptic (!)\] tools. In some ways we are getting to a final chapter of the narrative that has sought to shape the role of advice in the UK. Afterall, pension related income makes up over 70% of advisers’ remuneration too. So when fees, retirement and suitability combine as a focus for the FCA, the impact is intended to be significant. The basic requirement of demonstrating Suitability is access to the data and the research tools that can evidence both the expertise of the adviser, provide the highest standards of due diligence and disclosure, and provide reports and illustrations that can be used with clients.

","  Climate Change Analyst Sarasin & Partners   A decade of decarbonising power  The future of energy will be shaped by how we respond to its central paradox. How can we generate more energy with fewer emissions? The Paris Climate Agreement signalled a commitment to limit the increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C. Under all energy-system forecasts that keep temperatures below this level, the electricity-generation system must be entirely decarbonised, meaning its emissions should be close to zero. Yet electricity is only as green as its source. In 2019, the global electricity sector represented approximately a quarter of all global emissions. Fossil fuels have commanded a consistent 60-70% share last five years. The cheapest way to generate electricity is no longer from coal and gas but via onshore wind and solar power. The primary reason for this dramatic shift has been falling equipment costs. Solar module costs are almost 70% lower than five years ago, while wind turbines are now 40% cheaper than five years ago. Not only are wind turbines cheaper - they can also extract around 20% more energy from the same wind field. Cost deflation and technical advancements are likely to continue. Indeed, according to BNEF estimates, the levelised cost of electricity (an industry benchmark which include life cycle capital costs) for onshore wind is forecast to fall a further 50% by 2050, while utility  Ben McEwen  Head Of Equity Research Sarasin & Partners Alex Cobbold   8 “Existing utility companies face several challenges in pivoting their generation mix away from fossil fuels.”   of the global power-generation mix since the 1970s. Reducing emissions will require a material restructuring of the historically slow-moving global power-generation system. Energy-efficiency objectives have not succeeded in stemming the global demand for electricity, which is forecast to grow by 62% between 2019 and 2050. This increased demand is a function of three principal factors: global population growth, economic output increases (particularly in non-OECD countries such as India and across Africa), and the impetus to electrify processes historically based on fossil-fuel use. We are entering a decade of unprecedented disruption in electricity generation and consumption. The good news is that the electricity-generation cost landscape has already changed dramatically over the solar costs are forecast to come down by 63% across the same time frame. As the world strives to limit temperature increases, more electricity will have to be generated through renewables. Indeed the International Energy Agency’s Sustainable Development Scenario points towards renewable technologies representing two-thirds of electricity generation globally by 2040.  SYNAPTIC Connection Magazine  ","  The role of investment in a decarbonised energy system None of this comes without a significant investment into renewables. Projections vary depending on the extent of policy support but range from around $500 billion per annum to $700bn per annum, or some $10 trillion to $15 trillion on a cumulative basis between 2019 and 2040. Some projections are even greater. What does the renewable takeover mean for fossil fuels? Coal currently represents around 35% of global electricity generation but this number will decline to below 5% by 2050 and zero thereafter. Indeed, the global pipeline of new coal capacity is already shrinking, while older plants are now being pushed out by cheaper alternatives. Provisional estimates suggest that 2019 electricity production from coal is set to fall by 3% year on year. The role of oil and gas is set to fade. Spanish energy company Repsol recently announced that it will be transitioning to a net-zero-emissions company by 2050; it is the first oil and gas company in the world to assume this goal. But this decade is likely to see many more incumbent fossil fuel producers respond to the risks that rising carbon emissions present to society. Given the requirement for unprecedented levels of investment in renewables, it’s perhaps surprising to find that the universe of investment opportunities, whilst expanding, is still relatively small at around $1 trillion - less than a 25th of the size of the fossil fuel market it is disrupting. Why is this so? It’s already been noted that renewable technologies have experienced significant price deflation as technology and materials have evolved. However, the key factor has been economies of scale. Ten years ago, subsidies and tax breaks provided a cash-flow safety net for companies offering renewable solutions to an embryonic market, but these have now largely been withdrawn as adoption accelerates and volumes rise. Renewable company returns are now determined by market forces, which is at the heart of why the sector opportunities are still relatively limited. Existing utility companies face several challenges in pivoting their generation mix away from fossil fuels. The levelized cost of electricity generation for new investment may be lower for renewables, but they remain higher than those earned from partly or fully depreciated fossil-fuel assets. Compounding this is the fact that for the past decade, electricity demand in most developed markets has been benign. Utilities companies have therefore had little impetus to invest in new capacity. In the absence of subsidies, how to bridge the returns gap and navigate the transition towards renewables is a dilemma faced by many utility companies. Investors have been crowding into the few that have successfully led the transition and have been content to watch from the rest of the packs deliberations from the side lines. Management strategy has made other segments of the renewable supply chain unattractive for investors. Three wind turbine companies consolidating around 70% of a global market expanding at over 12% a year hints at an investment nirvana - one of pricing power and multidecade, double-digit volume growth. But in reality the scrum for market share and technical supremacy has effectively capped returns and set in motion a structural price deflation spiral. It’s a similar story in high-voltage electrical cables and perhaps at its worst in solar where there are very limited technical or material barriers to entry. The rush to the bottom has decimated returns and there is scant evidence that this won’t continue through the course of this decade as well. Here can opportunities be found? However, there are some bright spots. Carbon-offset prices have risen to the point that current coal-power generation in the EU is now uneconomic. Coupled with inter-governmental leapfrogging to decarbonise economies it suggests utilities will pivot sooner rather than later, forcing investors off the side lines. It also requires regulators to improve the returns that can be earned from monopoly-grid operations to ready the infrastructure for new and distributed capacity as well as rising loads. If costs can be contained and projects executed on time, grid infrastructure is likely to become an increasingly attractive global investment opportunity. We have identified several opportunities in electrical networks across European and North America where the trend of low-carbon power provides a decade or more of increasing returns to investors, almost irrespective of the prevailing economic environment. Wind farm operators remain in the sweet spot of strong order books and deflationary costs. Although it is a renewable technology which is becoming increasingly crowded, it’s a theme we identified early and the established market leaders, especially in offshore wind, are still able to earn superior returns to the newcomers due to their economies of scale and experience in project execution. Most participants in off- and onshore wind have also succeeded in replacing the largely withdrawn state power price subsidies with Purchasing Power Agreements (PPA) which lock in returns, providing investors with an attractive low-risk annuity income flow. As we head into another decade of compressing global yields, these characteristics are becoming increasingly rare yet are qualities highly sought by portfolio managers to balance risk. It is likely valuations will remain well supported into the future. However, the ultimate beneficiary of a decarbonised power market is society as a whole, giving the consumer the prospect of enjoying both structurally lower power prices whilst securing tomorrow.

Whilst most of us might not speak Greek, we will know the extent to which it has influenced the English language. Take the root word ‘idios’ which means ‘one’s own’ or ‘self’ leading to words like ‘idiosyncrasy’. But what does this have to do with the current pandemic and how we should consider investing? There’s no doubt we are experiencing unprecedented market risk (‘systematic’) but is the line between this and idiosyncratic risk (‘unsystematic’) becoming blurred, and if so, what can we take from this convergence?

Clearly we don t know the length and severity of the recession, this will depend how the virus is controlled and the availability of a vaccine. But if we consider that the ‘sudden stop’ in the world economy is like a power cut which has never been seen before and when the power comes back on we’ll need to assess the damage. Some companies will have fared well, some will have a pulse and some won’t have survived. For those that make it, the question will be if they are suited to the new environment and if not, do they have the resources and insight to adjust? As advisers, will there be a filter by which you can help your clients assess the future prospects of these companies post COVID-19? Looking beyond the ‘macro’, let’s also take a look at the response of the pandemic from a societal perspective to date (end of April), and consider how this will affect the lens through which we may examine the world (and companies) in the future. he cycled home to rapturous applause from our street all the way to his front door!).

Work Most of our industry have been adjusting to working from home and rising to the challenge of finding ways to help and calm our clients virtually. But many will believe we are more connected thanks to the increased usage of video conferencing and a willingness to be part of this. Who would’ve thought that people would be logging on after work to be doing online pub quizzes on Zoom? SYNAPTIC Connection Magazine  ","  Companies There’s no manual for companies to use to survive during this time; some have furloughed their staff, some have chosen not to despite being eligible, and some have changed their minds. What’s ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ is decidedly grey. On the other hand, some company behaviours have been clearer to judge; we’ve seen senior staff donate or cut their salaries and companies adapt their manufacturing lines to produce hand sanitiser or PPE, alongside large retailers leaving contracts unpaid and workers destitute. E, S and G Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) investing has been garnering more attention over the last few years. Some of the largest ESG funds are outperforming the broader market during the coronavirus crisis1. This could arguably be more of a lower carbon play, so in addition, it’s important to look over the longer term and, of course, in the post COVID-19 environment.  “COVID-19 could be a defining moment as we respond to what we’re experiencing and re-calibrate based on these experiences, our true values and those that are aligned to them.” If we look on a more generic level, two indices, the difference is noticeable.

But will the ‘S’ and ‘G’ now come to the fore? Some companies may be tarnished by their actions, while some may be more admired. Post COVID-19 will you and your clients think differently around your actions be it travel, consuming and investing? For example: • Will consumers question whether the company or provider supported their staff/suppliers as they deem fair? • Will this mean consumers will be less cost conscious and more values focused, a sort of value for peace of mind or will costs still be king? • Will you and your clients proactively want to be investing in companies that behaved well during the crisis from a moral and economic viewpoint? Going back to the Greek root word ‘idios’ meaning ‘one’s one’ or ‘self’... It is also the basis of the word ‘idiot’! Putting it into today’s context, those not displaying actions to benefit the collective could be akin to idiocy, especially for companies. ESG filters could be a way of helping advisers and their clients sift out those that won’t survive in the new world where moral alignment is another consideration alongside price, service and product. And going back to the initial question, when it comes to investing it could be that you and your clients will be saying ‘adios’ to those companies and providers who don’t align to values in a post pandemic by showing too much ‘idios’ during it!

FE Investments  12 The current economic crisis caused by the Covid-19 outbreak is a unique situation. The last 100 years have seen banking crises, stock market crashes and recessions, with the odd depression thrown in for good measure. These were sometimes inter-linked but there is no common cause for previous recessions. Governments and regulators have a mixed record for dealing with economic crises but what makes the current situation unique is that the economic crisis has been caused deliberately by governments putting economies into suspended animation to prevent an even worse social and health crisis. Whether we are heading for recession is not really in doubt. Initial Q1 GDP figures from China show the first quarterly contraction in almost 40 years and developed economies are expected to follow suit when the first data is published shortly. This is despite the shutdown only being introduced in mid to late March in most countries. Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane said this week that shock to the UK’s economy in March is sufficient for Q1 GDP to contract and he expects the figures for Q2 to be ‘very ugly’. The OECD has produced an initial assessment of the damage done to GDP Economic sectors most at risk of partial or complete shutdowns on activity in the G7 economies in 2020 Per cent of GDP in constant prices. Source: OECD, March/April 2020 amongst G7 economies. It estimates the shutdown will cut around 2 per cent of annual GDP growth for every month of shutdown with the damage most keenly felt in sectors such as retail, property and transport. The rapid economic slowdown and financial market correction has naturally led to speculation about how long any recession will last and what shape the economic recovery will take. The global economy is going to be on pause for another quarter, at least, and it is impossible to get any meaningful view of the path to recovery until we know the extent of the economic damage the shutdown has caused. There has been no shortage of predictions about how severe the economic effects of the shutdown will be. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has predicted that 3 per cent will be wiped from global GDP this year, with the effect more pronounced in developed economies.   SYNAPTIC Connection Magazine  ","World Economic Outlook April 2020 - Growth Projections The COVID-19 health crisis will have a severe impact on economic activity in 2020 Source: IMF, World Economic Outlook April 2020 In the UK, the Office for Budget Responsibility suggests that each month of full lockdown will reduce monthly output by 35%, reducing annual GDP by 3% for each month the shutdown continues. We’re already more than one month into the shutdown in the UK, with at least another two weeks to go before the situation is reviewed again. Despite not having a house view on short to medium- term outlook for economic growth, it is helpful to look at the different scenarios that could play out as the response to Covid-19 evolves. Early speculation that the world was in for a short ‘V-shaped’ recession - a short shutdown followed by equally swift rebound - may be the first of the multiple views of future GDP growth to become a victim of the coronavirus. The Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Asset Managers Survey for April shows just 15 per cent of fund managers now think we are going to see a swift recovery. More than 50 per cent of fund managers are expecting a ‘U-shaped’ recovery - a sharp drop in economic activity followed by a period of low or no economic growth followed by a rapid recovery when countries reopen. Expectations for how long the period of low economic growth will last vary depending on individual countries response to the virus but the longer the shutdown continues, the more severe the impacts will be. The April YPO Chief Executive Global Survey, which includes response from over 3,500 chief executives, shows 64 per cent expect the current crisis to have a negative effect on revenues a year from now. The most pessimistic scenario is for an ‘L-shaped recovery’, where the sharp drop in economic activity leads to a long period of economic stagnation. This is particularly a risk where the recent rapid rise in unemployment is not quickly corrected and household finances and consumer confidence are damaged. The final scenario is for a series of shutdowns and rapid recoveries caused by governments having to repeatedly reintroduce restrictions following further outbreaks of Covid-19. This ‘W-shaped’ recovery could be repeated until either a vaccine is developed, aggressive tracing and monitoring is introduced around the world or countries decide the economic cost is too great and it is better to learn to live with the effects of the new disease. It is too early to say which way we are headed. The longer the shutdown goes on the less likely it is that economies can simply bounce back to pre-crisis levels and the greater the chance that ‘scarring’ will occur. In addition to the decision on how to deal with the immediate healthcare crisis, the UK now faces a series of choices about how to deal with the economic effects. As Institute for Fiscal Studies director Paul Johnson pointed out recently, perhaps more important than the shape and duration of the recession will be how we react when restrictions are lifted: “Even if the economy is released from lockdown by the summer, the policy priorities and choices facing government will be utterly different from those of what seems like a lifetime ago when it assumed office in December. How it makes those choices could prove even more important than the immediate response to the crisis.” We hope you have found this update helpful.

The question, especially now given the unprecedented challenges we are facing with covid-19, is where to invest. Like many other investment solutions, this will depend on what the investors’ objectives are; for example, high income or wealth preservation. For this write-up, let’s zoom in on a client looking for wealth preservation and a relatively small income of 4%. To start, when it comes to wealth preservation, the focus lies less with the upside and more on how to manage potential downside risks both in terms of depth and duration. For instance, the client first might be inclined to invest in fixed income, which is traditionally considered the lowest risk asset class after cash. Anyone doing this with a need for some income (even one of 4%) would have seen higher levels of drawdown compared with multi-asset investments. The unceasing demand for multi-asset, in this respect, becomes clear since investing in multiple asset classes provides lower correlation than being invested in one and that helps to Drawdown 2010-2020 reduce drawdown, which is very important for preserving wealth. It is also worth noting that when we have seen levels of drawdown increase across the 0-35% shares sector over the past decade, it was often because the fund was venturing into riskier assets to reap the same level of returns seen in the previous ten years. This is why we believe it makes sense for such clients to look at funds specifically designed for lower risk appetites rather than at more generic funds; for example, the 0-35% shares sector, which is widely perceived as the least risky within the IA mixed investment sectors. Simply put, any client looking for a ‘sustainable’ withdrawal rate is likely to have more success with a designated low risk level fund because it has the potential to be much more reliable for reducing drawdown risk and therefore could be extra helpful at preserving wealth whilst also taking an income.

Our team of fund managers believe that while the correction was of the right magnitude in value, the pace was too fast and that in time the lows may be revisited. Within that, they are wary of non-essential goods companies and are focusing on tech and other selective areas expected to outperform throughout the pandemic. In fixed income, we believe corporate bonds remain the most attractive asset and continue to concentrate on high quality credits in non-cyclical sectors, mainly in Europe given the European Central Bank’s ongoing purchasing programme. For example, as the sell-off unfolded throughout March, we were able to take on new positions in credits that had particularly suffered while still offering strong liquidity features to weather the crisis (e.g. large cash positions or potential government support). We will continue to look for companies that we feel are unfairly punished and provide attractive valuation opportunities. More important than ever in our decision-making process are the consultations with our internal credit analysts as well as the wider fund management team at Canada Life Investments. Although social distancing means we are no longer in meeting rooms and these conversations take place via conference calls and videos, they have been vital in our current weightings and risk monitoring.

CLI01610 Expiry 30/04/2021   Q2 2020 15  ","  Know your fund manager    Jon Lycett Business Development Manager RSMR  16 It’s funny what we miss when we suddenly find ourselves in a completely unfamiliar situation. The social distancing that we’re all living with (is it pessimistic of me to assume that we’re still in lockdown when this article goes to print?) means that my usual weekly routine of travelling around the country has become a distant memory.  I miss travelling so much, even short journeys provide an opportunity for some headspace - anyone currently trying to balance work with home-schooling will know what I mean. I’m even starting to think that I’m missing traffic jams and roadworks, but maybe that’s just cabin fever. Having said all that, I’ve been pleasantly surprised at the relative ease with which I’ve managed to adapt to lockdown working, and impressed at how colleagues and clients alike have acclimatised to working remotely and continued to work pretty much as normal through these extraordinary times. My role at RSMR means that I’m in daily contact with financial advisers from all around the country. I know how hard everyone is working to make sure that investors continue to receive high levels of service and the reassurance that’s needed in these volatile times. Much has been said in recent years about robo-advice and the threat that this poses to the advice profession but right now, the value of having a personal connection to a trusted adviser (even if it’s via Zoom rather than in person) who can empathise and help each client to see the bigger picture, is way beyond what any automated system could ever hope to provide. Lockdown aside, what steps can an adviser take to maximise client facing time? Well, that’s where we come in. A large of part of RSMR’s work is designed to help advisers spend less time in the back office and more time managing client relationships. The adviser firms that RSMR works with, either through our discretionary models or our broader retainer relationships, recognise the benefit of outsourcing tasks such as fund research and portfolio management. It means that everyone is playing to their strengths; the adviser has the knowledge and skill to create sound financial plans for their clients and RSMR has the knowledge and resources to ensure that any investment plan is based on expertly assessed and rigorously applied research. RSMR assesses funds based on a whole range of performance and risk data, but that’s only part of the story. To add true value, we need to dig deeper to understand how a fund is managed, the processes that are followed and the likelihood of it ‘doing what it says on the tin’ in the future.  SYNAPTIC Connection Magazine  ","  “A large of part of RSMR’s work is designed to help advisers spend less time in the back office and more time managing client relationships.”  17   This is why we place greater emphasis on qualitative research and a one to one meeting with a fund manager is key to this - it enhances our understanding of a fund and provides the opportunity to ask OUR questions (not just the ones the fund manager wants to answer). We’ll often have two or more meetings and send different members of the team to look at a fund from different angles. Preparation is important for these meetings to make sure that we’re focused on the most important areas and can tease out the tiniest details. Getting an understanding of a manager’s career history is critical. We want to know why they were attracted to the fund management industry and what roles they’ve previously held. We look beyond the lead manager and find out about the other team members. All this helps create a picture of the overall team style and their motivations and will also show whether they have a real passion for the job. It’s also important to find out about the other responsibilities a manager has, to understand how much time is devoted to the fund. We look beyond the fund size and consider the total amount in the strategy; because liquidity can impact on performance, especially in less liquid markets. If the sub-fund is small, but the total amount of AUM in the strategy is large, then it might not be as nimble as it appears. When considering performance, we look at the longer- term strategy on a discrete year basis. It demonstrates whether outperformance has been generated on a consistent basis, or just through one or two particularly strong years. In turn, this helps us to recognise when a fund might struggle. In terms of the investment process, we look at how responsibilities in the team are divided, and how long the process has been in place. This helps us to determine if it’s been tested through different economic cycles. Finding out what a manager is trying to achieve is key - targeted alpha can vary between country/sector/ stock so we need to identify what a manager is looking for in individual companies and what sell disciplines are in place - many fund managers find selling harder than buying. Risk management is a meaningful part of the discussion so that we can visualise which controls are in place at country, sector, stock or market capitalisation levels. Finding out whether a manager uses tracking error or Var is significant, as is looking at minimum/maximum stock positions and whether leverage is being used in portfolio construction. We will also ask about turnover. Turnover costs money, but some managers implement trading strategies successfully. If turnover shoots up at a time when a manager is underperforming, it can demonstrate a lack of conviction and indicate potential further underperformance. Finally, we focus on a manager’s current strategy and the types of positions held in the portfolio and we check that these fit with the process they’ve outlined. We look at whether the worst positions of the fund over the last 12 months are still held, and if so, why. If all these questions (and more) are convincingly answered, then we’ll decide whether to give the fund an RSMR rating, which in turn may also lead to it being selected for our portfolios. As you can see, this is a lengthy process requiring expertise, time and resource. Which is why, if you’re a firm that wants to be truly client centric, you should explore the benefits of outsourcing this vital part of the investment process.

We explore their role as shock absorbers during periods of market stress. The economic repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic have brought sharp declines in equity markets in recent weeks, with investors looking to their bond exposures to cushion some of the blow. In March, however, the value of fixed income securities and funds fell across a wide range of durations and currencies. Even the traditional ‘safe haven’ of developed market government bonds failed to provide refuge from the market turbulence in this period, with yield curves rising at certain periods to compound investor pain. The Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Treasuries index (GBP hedged) was down -0.17% in March. While the Bloomberg Barclays Gilt index rose 1.52%, developed market government bonds in many regions fell, with the Bloomberg Barclays Germany and France Treasuries (GBP hedged) indices down -1.26% and -2.71%, respectively. Figure 1. Performance of government bond indices for different durations during worst quartile of equity performance The simultaneous fall in both bonds and equities has raised questions about the diversification benefits of fixed income securities and their role as shock absorbers during periods of market distress. The rationale for maintaining a balance between bonds and equities is based on the understanding that bond returns tend to move in the opposite direction to equity returns. A healthy exposure to bond markets should provide investors with a cushion to absorb some of the losses when equity markets inevitably tumble. This feature is normally enhanced for longer-duration bonds as highlighted by Figure 1.   Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results.Sources: FTSE All-World Index in GBP and Bloomberg Barclays Global Treasury (GBP Hedged) indices. Data from 31 January 1999 to 31 March 2020. SYNAPTIC Connection Magazine  ","   “One of the observable trends during distressed markets is the ‘flight to quality’, but in the case of the Covid-19 pandemic we have seen a ‘flight to cash’.”  Investment risk information: The value of investments, and the income from them, may fall or rise and investors may get back less than they invested. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results. Funds investing in fixed interest securities carry the risk of default on repayment and erosion of the capital value of your investment and the level of income may fluctuate. Movements in interest rates are likely to affect the capital value of fixed interest securities. Corporate bonds may provide higher yields but as such may carry greater credit risk increasing the risk of default on repayment and erosion of the capital value of your investment. The level of income may fluctuate and movements in interest rates are likely to affect the capital value of bonds.  19   So, why were bond valuations falling at the same time as equities? And does that mean that the relationship that we have been relying on for asset allocation is dead and that bonds no longer play the role of risk diversifiers in a multi-asset portfolio? One of the observable trends during distressed markets is the ‘flight to quality’, but in the case of the Covid-19 pandemic we have seen a ‘flight to cash’. By that we mean investors are selling their equity and higher-risk bond (high-yield) positions, holding the cash and waiting for the volatility and uncertainty to reduce. Similarly, asset managers facing redemptions tend to sell their most liquid assets first, which are typically developed market government bonds and high-quality corporate bonds. This has put further downward pressure on bond prices as it happened in tandem with the economic reaction to the spread of Covid-19 (e.g., layoffs, declines in growth as a result of the containment measures). Although difficult to forecast, the flight to cash is likely to be temporary, and once market confidence bounces back and investors buy back into marginally riskier assets, the correction could be sharp. Another explanation is that the large fiscal packages that have been rolled out in the US and Europe have put upward pressure on government bond yields as markets price in the added credit risk associated with more borrowing. If the fiscal stimulus works, though, we should see a reversion in government bond yields over the next couple of months. In fact, we should think about why equity and bond returns tend to move in opposite directions. The conditions for that to hold are related to how monetary policy responds to equity sell-offs. Over the past 20 years or more, since central banks widely adopted inflation-targeting policies, they have responded to economic growth shocks by rapidly lowering interest rates (and therefore bond yields), which ultimately pushes bond returns up. This is exactly how central banks have been responding to the Covid-19 shock. Of course, this dynamic does work less effectively when interest rates are already low, as in the current economic environment. When yields are already very low, there is less room for them to decrease further and therefore bonds provide less downside protection compared to a high interest rate environment. But even then, they still provide some protection. High market volatility is the result of many variables impacting the market at the same time, including irrational human behaviour. With that in mind, we can’t expect the negative correlation in equity and bond prices to hold each and every day, but rather on average over the investment horizon. For now, there is no reason to abandon the long-standing position that bonds will perform their duty as shock absorbers in multi-asset portfolios.

"," Sustainability, the new ‘safe haven’ for investors?   During times of crisis, conventional wisdom suggests investors retreat into tried and trusted ‘safe havens’, such as gold or long- dated government bonds. This mindset views sustainable investing as a green trend, or something of a luxury during serious times. I have even heard the argument that clients have too much on their minds right now to consider the benefits of sustainable investing. This thinking belongs in the past. Funds focused on quality companies with strong environmental, social and governance (ESG) policies have fared better during the current crisis, most of them outperforming conventional benchmarks. But as the collective response to this crisis evolves, it’s becoming undeniable that from an investment perspective, backing those companies demonstrating a strong commitment to a clear set of values is logically the only place to be. To paraphrase economist Alex Edmans, the only way a company can ‘Grow the Pie’ in a sustainable manner, is to treat all stakeholders equally and fairly, and by doing this creating more future value and profit, effectively creating revenue for all stakeholders. Behaviour will make or break brands The greatest global health crisis for a century is creating a major change in corporate behaviour. Companies have been forced to re-assess their relationships with their customers, employees, suppliers and the wider community, instead of just addressing the short-term needs of shareholders. Recent research by BofAML shows that companies that have performed well during the height of the COVID crisis have demonstrated superior product, health and safety scores, as well as better workforce policy scores.

As everyone learns to adapt to - and define - the ‘new normal’, there’s a strong case to suggest sustainable investment funds offer potential, for their efficiency in managing underlying risks, delivering more resilient returns and for their positive contribution to the planet and society.”  “Companies that have performed well during the height of the COVID crisis have demonstrated superior product, health and safety scores, as well as better workforce policy scores.”  21   Firms that truly value their stakeholder relationships should be best placed to emerge from this crisis. Loyalty and compassion shown to employees; fair treatment of suppliers; transforming production lines to provide critical care equipment; business owners making personal sacrifices or direct donations, these are all crucial factors which may see some firms reap the benefits of customer loyalty and brand equity when supply chains start to recover. Companies revealed to be lacking in these departments are more likely to fall out of favour. The green imperative remains Some market participants have suggested that environmental-related targets and the EU Green Deal may be suspended indefinitely. For example, the ‘Farm to Fork’ initiative was delayed after farmers cited coronavirus disruptions. Food sustainability is one of the central tenets of the European Green Deal, and while COVID-19 is creating disruption, it’s unlikely that delays will be indefinite. In addition, while the Cop26 climate talks have been postponed until 2021, the EU Council has requested that post-COVID-19, economic stimulus should include and accelerate green spending. This is a long-term movement that may be interrupted but will not be derailed. Within the energy industry, despite the economic slump, renewable energy companies remain competitive in general. Meanwhile, all major oil companies in Europe have announced capital expenditure cuts of around 20%. It’s increasingly likely that in an environment where cutting dividends is both financially prudent and ‘the right thing to do’, we could see more companies use this cash to build out more solar and wind plants, or pay for highly profitable electronic charging points, instead of feeling compelled to maintain investment in legacy businesses that offer lower profitability due to falling oil prices. Forward-thinking firms now have the opportunity to capitalise on their prime positions. An end to short-term thinking? Short-termism has been a major obstacle to sustainability needs for decades now. But with dividend cuts anticipated across most market sectors, companies that focused only on keeping shareholders happy have lost the critical buffer that kept them ahead during volatile market conditions. While it would be naïve to expect shareholder considerations to take a back seat indefinitely, with the world facing ‘great depression’ territory, companies find themselves on a much more level playing field. This makes many more likely to keep dividend pay-outs low and C-Suite remuneration packages conservative in the medium term at least. A chance for investors to look to the future For investors, there’s a clear imperative to consider sustainable investment funds. Such portfolios already feature forward-thinking companies that have demonstrated their embrace of ESG principles, their commitment to all stakeholders, and their focus on achieving long-term goals. These are the investments capable of delivering robust returns in a post-COVID environment.

Where risk really resides...  Does an economic downturn impact markets? It can be tempting to predict where the economy or earnings cycle is heading. That is, in theory, we could pick when (or which part of) the market is about to weaken and seek shelter until it reaches a cyclical low. The challenge, of course, is that this approach is notoriously difficult to do because you need to predict the future twice - once to get out of risky assets at the right time and again to re- enter them at the bottom of the cycle. Even the market has difficulty pricing in such signals. For example, in mid-2018 the global bond markets started pricing in a deteriorating economy while global equity markets were pricing in a further expansion. Then it suddenly reversed in late-2018, as equity markets priced in a decline while bond markets did the opposite. This shows that investors have a hard time pricing economic declines. So, what does that mean in a multi-asset portfolio context? To us, it means a few things. First, a key when dealing with fears of a severe global recession is to distinguish between true risk (a negative long- term knock to corporate fundamentals) and negative sentiment (investors repricing their expectations).  CFA, Portfolio Manager Morningstar Investment Management Europe Ltd  Mark Preskett  22      Exhibit 1 For more than 100 years, prices have oscillated around the fundamental return. An economic recession can dent the fundamentals temporarily, however it rarely causes permanent impairment.

Note: Total Return is the return of the S&P 500 Index, Fundamental Return is the return of total payout yield plus the growth in total payouts, Growth expectations is the market’s implied growth rate assuming a constant cost of equity.    Adding Value in a Downturn We believe investors can benefit by buying into negative sentiment, especially if they are willing to take a long-term view. The long-term nature should not be underestimated given most economic recessions prove temporary and are recoverable in the investor timeframe. By taking such an approach, we can be anti-cyclical (or “contrarian”) when others aren’t. Furthermore, sustaining a recession will likely be easier if the motive is to be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful, to paraphrase Warren Buffett. We seek to not only sustain downturns, but to help our investors profit from them. This tends to be possible because negative sentiment is often exacerbated in a crisis. For evidence, we show the difference between changes in sentiment and fundamentals during the Great Financial Crisis of 2007 to 2009. The second consideration in a multi-asset context is to diversify our risk drivers. This goes beyond questions about the recession or whether inflation may rise during the recovery period. We may seek to understand the answers to these questions (and many more) within the context of valuations, but also by acknowledging the role of uncertainty. Diversification is not only about spreading your eggs Diversification is an important tool to manage uncertainty, however we believe it must go beyond “spreading your eggs across multiple baskets”. To us, it is about understanding the underlying risks to assets - whether that be economic or market risk factors - not just correlations or volatility. For example, corporate bonds and equity markets can behave very differently, yet both are susceptible to an economic shock (damage to corporate earnings could cause equity values to fall and bond spreads to widen). All else being equal, this offers less diversification than holding equities with an unrelated asset such as inflation-linked bonds or nominal government bonds. The message is to diversify against fundamental risks if you want to reduce the impact of an economic recession. Bringing this together, we don’t necessarily buy into the rhetoric that one should sell based on fears of a severe global economic recession. Naturally, we want to be diversified to reduce the impact of any downturn, but by taking a long-term view, we should only really care about a permanent impairment to earnings. Moreover, if the economic cycle meaningfully dents corporate profits in the near term, we may have the opportunity to buy into the negative sentiment and ride it out until the cycle reverts. This is one of many areas we can add value, by maintaining a long-term view when others won’t.

Q2 2020 “We believe investors can benefit by buying into negative sentiment, especially if they are willing to take a long-term view.” 23  ","  Why are advisers selecting on-platform DFMs?   Aegon Investment Team  24  Outsourcing to industry experts offers interesting opportunities to change the way businesses work. The mighty Apple is a great example of a serial outsourcer. Its computers use microchips supplied by Intel. By using this partner expertise Apple was able to focus on the interface design work it does best - but it’s an Apple computer, with the Apple brand, that the customer buys. We’re continuing to see a similar use of outsourced expertise in the world of financial advice. Outsourced platform technology has become commonplace, and a growing value of advised assets under administration1 complement this by using the on-platform investment capabilities of discretionary fund managers (DFMs). The aim is to create compelling client propositions while improving business efficiency. Like Apple, financial advisers are increasingly recognising the value of outsourcing, in particular, to access specialist investment expertise. And likewise, DFMs are recognising the huge potential of the platform market to grow their businesses. SYNAPTIC Connection Magazine  ","   Platforms have given DFMs access to wider market Traditionally, DFMs were associated with high-net-worth clients, they dealt directly with clients personally, and did not market themselves to a retail audience. But things have changed. Some DFMs realised before the 2008-9 financial crisis that a burgeoning mass affluent population might benefit from a more sophisticated investment approach. They didn’t have the distribution, but the development of adviser-led platforms has provided them with access to this market. Governance capabilities Few advisers have the governance capabilities required to build and monitor sophisticated investment portfolios. Doing so is costly and leaves businesses exposed to market movements both good and bad. DFMs are being appointed because advisers are confident they can add value to the client, and simplify their business processes, by outsourcing the implementation of the investment strategy to an expert. This lets them concentrate on providing a more holistic financial planning service to the client. Outsourcing fund selection, asset allocation, and ongoing fund governance to an expert DFM can reduce investment risk and governance cost, but it comes with a new commitment to perform the appropriate due diligence on those DFMs the adviser recommends. In addition to governance, the introduction of MiFID II (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II) in January 2018 increased investor protection, transparency, fund provider and distributor suitability obligations, and simplified investor communications, including investor notifications if the value drops significantly on any given day. Here again, platform technology can help because the investment detail is all online for the adviser to view. Simple administration There’s also an alignment between the target market of most advice firms and the services offered by DFMs. Most DFMs target their services at investors with £100,000 or more to invest and have the research capabilities to offer the more sophisticated investment strategies that these investors often demand. Their focus on portfolio-building alone means they can take full advantage of the huge range of investments - including exchange-traded funds (ETFs) - that platforms often offer, and have more scope to make tactical changes. The alternative for the adviser is often to meet the demand for sophistication using model portfolios. These models come with an extensive administrative burden as consent is required each time the portfolios are changed. In contrast, investment permissions are granted at the outset when using a DFM. This means they can make changes without consulting clients every time, so they can react quickly to changing market environments. This is administratively simpler and gives scope for a more tactical approach. Some platforms also pay the DFM and adviser separately, further simplifying the administration by removing the need for the adviser to pass on any DFM fees. Digital transparency Platforms are the perfect facilitator for these sorts of partnerships, allowing the DFM to build and manage portfolios, advisers to monitor them on clients’ behalf and both to sculpt their business models to suit.

"," New world, new opportunities Why income sustainability should be the guide for navigating the new world.      John Stopford Portfolio Manager of Diversified Income Fund Ninety One    Jason Borbora-Sheen Portfolio Manager of Diversified Income Fund Ninety One  28 One notable occurrence during the recent COVID-19 market turmoil was the underperformance of higher-yielding assets - both across and within asset classes - which contrasts with typical outperformance in previous bear markets. One of the hardest hit areas was within equities, where the government-imposed lockdown measures have halted activity - putting severe pressure on companies to cut dividends to preserve cash. This presents a conundrum for income investors, with the reduction of these payouts forcing them to reconsider how they source yield. However, the sell- off has created some of the best risk-adjusted return opportunities - across equities and bonds - that we’ve seen in years. Navigating this new world won’t be easy - and is a long-term journey. We believe the winners and losers will be separated by factors of sustainability (of income), which relies on the fundamental quality of the companies in a portfolio. Dealing with dividends Why are dividends being cut? In an economic crisis of this size, liquidity is key, with companies desperate to preserve cash as a balance sheet buffer. Dividends are often the first port of call, and while this is understandable, it doesn’t bode well for income investors reliant on these payments. But we think there’s a fundamental problem with dividend-hunting, which may have left investors unnecessarily exposed to dividend risk. Indices like the S&P 500 Dividends Aristocrats - a global index of the highest dividend stocks that have maintained their dividends for ten years - is often cited as a good source of quality dividend payers. However, many companies will often take on additional leverage to maintain those dividends, rather than these distributions being based ‘natural profitability’ generated by robust business models. Unfortunately, this spike in dividend risk facing income investors will continue for many months as companies adapt to the new world. Avoiding over-leveraged companies and any signs of creative accounting is crucial. The focus needs to be on bottom-up fundamental research with a laser focus on a company’s profitability and capital allocation decisions across their supply chains. At Ninety One, we have a concentrated portfolio - tens rather than thousands - because we want to have full understanding of what’s in our portfolios at any given time. The result is a highly differentiated portfolio of stocks compared to traditional dividend indices, which gives us more confidence that the assets we hold will continue to provide the risk- adjusted returns we’re seeking. New opportunities Valuations were transformed after the COVID-19 crash. But, with the unprecedented response from governments and central banks, the amount of liquidity which flushed the market resulted in rapid stabilisation. Now, the yield on our investible universe is the highest we’ve seen in several years. In the aftermath, corporate bonds presented the most attractive opportunity, as the forced liquidation of many portfolios during the sell-off led to underperformance. This led to yields increasing significantly, prompting a rally as markets stabilised. In particular, we believe many high-quality investment grade companies have been unfairly sold off, creating very attractive risk-reward opportunities. We also see selective opportunities in high yield debt, listed infrastructure and across equities. The transformation has been sudden, however the uncertainty has generated new opportunities. A patient approach is crucial; while headline yields may appear attractive, investors must do their research to uncover those long-term opportunities which can offer sustainable incomes and thereby meet their risk-adjusted return goals. All investments carry the risk of capital loss. The value of investments, and any income generated from them, can fall as well as rise and will be affected by changes in interest rates, currency fluctuations, general market conditions and other political, social and economic developments, as well as by specific matters relating to the assets in which the investment strategy invests. If any currency differs from the investor’s home currency, returns may increase or decrease as a result of currency fluctuations. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results.

It has also brought to attention that having insurance to cover their loss of income, due to unemployment, accident or sickness, is equally as important, if not more, than other optional insurances and lifestyle expenses. Surge of conscience In the last few months, the market has seen an exponential increase in enquiries for unemployment insurance. This sudden surge of conscience has resulted from the increasing realisation of the ‘what if...’ conundrum. There is now a profound recognition that people must address these challenges, and they should not be ignored or deferred. The ability to maintain payments for monthly financial commitments and to avoid falling into debt is now an urgent necessity. There is an increasing appreciation that a policy of this type prevents people from dipping into their savings and contingency funds. And instead of dismissing with the usual adage of ‘I could put the same monthly premium into a savings pot and use that’, most people now realise the substantial returns such cover provides them, along with the priceless ‘peace of mind’. While I concede the ‘live now, worry about debt later’ philosophy may still be rife amongst many, I’m encouraged by those who now openly acknowledge their financial stability concerns and are keen to take steps to risk manage their situations now and in the future. This new realisation has led to a resurgence of demand for Accident, Sickness and Unemployment insurances. Role of Best Insurance Best Insurance is one of UK’s largest providers of Accident, Sickness and Unemployment Insurance. We have a range of policies from a wide range of insurers. For the past decade, we have been continuously refining and improving the product benefits, enhancing eligibility, making it easier for brokers to access and submit applications. As a full-service provider, Best Insurance’s role starts from designing the products in close conjunction with the insurers, modelling pricing and value, collecting premiums and managing the full life cycle of the customers. This 360-degree approach allows Best to ensure that customers get the appropriate levels of service and support, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction and retention. SYNAPTIC Connection Magazine  "," “In the last few months, the market has seen an exponential increase in enquiries for unemployment insurance. This sudden surge of conscience has resulted from the increasing realisation of the ‘what if...’ conundrum.”   33    Why should brokers look at ASU? Let me dwell a little on some of the ASU myths. They’re complex to sell. This is not the case. We provide cover on a requirement, rather than underwriting basis. Simple questions are asked and from the responses given, appropriate products and quotes are given, matching customers’ requirements in minutes. Advisers are fully supported with product training and a self-serve dashboard which will reduce their administration time. Insurers do not cover the self-employed or contractors. Incorrect. Our portfolio has products suitable for self-employed and contractors. Our stipulation is that they have paid their Class 1 National Insurance contributions and work more than 16 hours per week. A mortgage or loan must be in place in order to buy a policy. Not true. While for many this may be the main reason for purchasing cover in the first place, policies are available that do not require such a commitment. It’s too expensive. Premiums start at £30.00 per £1,000 of benefit - less than the price of a daily latte. At Best, we routinely review our pricing model to ensure that they deliver value to customers and are affordable and competitive. Low commission when compared to other products such as life. The commissions on ASU is paid monthly until the policy expires at retirement age or is cancelled by the customer. This regular recurring income adds attractive more bottom-line value when a business is valued. The approach also eliminates the risk of expensive clawbacks and its impact on cash flows, which has brought many businesses to its knees. Easy to understand products, high value to customers and an attractive recurring income stream makes ASU an attractive proposition to the brokers. The most important part of the whole process is access to ASU products in an efficient and seamless manner, and that is exactly where Synaptic Software comes in. Synaptic will shortly be launching a comprehensive range of ASU products in conjunction with Best Insurance. In most instances, you will be able to access them through your existing account with Synaptic, seek quotes and submit applications. You will hear more about this in the coming weeks. The future of ASU The ASU range of policies provide a true all-around win-win - customer, broker, and the insurer. It is certainly one of those policies where the customer is more likely to make a claim when compared to any other category within the protection sector. Offering ASU policies will allow brokers to have in-depth conversations with customers on strategies for their cashflow, which will open up other opportunities ranging from other protection products to investment management, thus enhancing value from their customers.

It is the most adaptable. The ability to reflect fully on the truth of this axiom is only really possible when survival has been threatened, as it has for many of us during the coronavirus pandemic, whether at the level of society, home or work. It is easier to adapt if you are flexible, and flexibility implies balance and the ability to test and challenge. Creating a ‘culture of challenge’ was highlighted as the basis of good research in the seminal FCA Thematic Review paper TR16/1 ’Assessing suitability: research and due diligence of products and services’. The paper identified good research as an ongoing process, constantly curious and constantly testing. Poor research was also identified as the principle cause of ‘poor advice outcomes’, no less. How right they are. As the UK moves away from the coronavirus peak, it is clear that testing is emerging as one of the most potent weapons in the fight to alleviate lock-down conditions. At the time of writing and prior to mass testing, we are flying relatively ‘blind’ and unable to adapt to conditions effectively as a result. There is an analogy to be drawn between the critical role that testing assumes in these difficult times, and the role of research in investment advice. Good research is critical to advisers, who understand the reliance clients have on them to navigate towards successful outcomes as part of the financial planning process, in all types of inclement weather. The role of Synaptic is to produce data and applications to perform investment platform, product, portfolio and fund research - including accurate costs and charges analysis, risk profiling - making compliance possible, but more importantly, enabling advisers to exercise their expertise in their role of custodians of their clients’ life savings. Research can make the difference between hardship in old age and a comfortable retirement. It really is that stark. All over the country retirees are quietly benefitting from the measured effectiveness of their advisers’ planning. With such high stakes, it is obvious why there is little room for failure. Risk is the currency of the professional adviser, and mastering risk is the core competency of investment advice. The regulator has evolved an approach to risk that requires a customer’s ‘need to take’ risk (to acquire growth and beat inflation) to be balanced with their appetite for risk and ability to bear loss. This means that if a client experiences changes to their portfolios that they are not prepared for, do not understand, or result in losses they cannot afford, the adviser would be at fault. The models provided by Moody’s for risk management, employed by Synaptic customers, have provided a framework for the advice, predicting accurately the range of performance and potential losses of portfolios, ensuring that clients are not over-exposed to losses nor overly surprised by any volatility experienced by their portfolios. The downturn of 2008 (also referred to in the industry as the Great Financial Crisis) and currently, the experience of the coronavirus pandemic (as yet unresolved), prove that circumstances can and do change with dizzying speed. But in the spirit of the FCA’s on-going challenge and re-evaluation, advisers and customers relying on good research and processes are flying with full visibility and adapting to potentially catastrophic conditions to survive and thrive another day. The latter reflecting portfolios with well-constructed asset allocations and re-balanced correctly. There can be no room for undue speculation. The principles of diversification and the long-term asset allocation strategies available to advisers ensure that investment success is mathematically as certain as is possible, assuming the markets are able to pursue their SYNAPTIC Connection Magazine  "," “Risk is the currency of the professional adviser, and mastering risk is the core competency of investment advice.

Justin Urquhart -Stewart used to remark that clients liked to ‘gamble’ on the periphery of their wealth or assets, but on the proviso that there is no room for gambling in a portfolio if it intended to support a client’s financial objective. Investment relies on term, or investment ‘horizon’ to ensure that what certainty exists in the markets can be harnessed constructively - staying clear of speculation. It is why we use probability-based projections to identify all viable outcomes, including the most far-fetched. It is also why our risk models, in line with all good research, are constantly updated and reviewed, so that your investment can be managed effectively. It is also why projections support the formulation of strategies designed to survive the coldest investment winters and create the right kind of reliance on markets to deliver results. The coronavirus pandemic has caused our customers and their clients concern about market and portfolio losses: The principle areas of concern: 1. Ability to monitor the markets 2. Ability to monitor clients’ portfolios 3. Ability to put a risk framework around portfolio movements that would: a. Put losses into perspective b. Explain short and longer term prospects c. Indicate whether short term interventions were required d. Manage asset allocation strategy in short and longer term horizons (rebalancing) e. Answer the question ‘how worried should you be’? What Synaptic Research offers: 1. Ability to access timely data relating to client investments 2. Ability to construct, test and rebalance notional portfolios 3. Provide analysis via the Moody’s risk framework to understand loss, future growth and asset allocation What the coronavirus pandemic has reinforced: 1. Importance of research to anticipate investment performance and reassure clients 2. Importance of communicating with clients, including tables and charts to demonstrate risk and return 3. Importance of an investment strategy that is asset allocation and term based 4. Importance of adhering to an academically sound risk management model, combining: a. The need to take risk b. Capacity for Loss c. Attitude to Risk 5. Importance of quantifying losses expected within competing strategies, underlying the decisions of all advisers to correctly pitch risk to their clients. No client should be in a strategy that presents them with surprise, horror or sleepless nights To provide perspective in respect of the key indexes that contribute to the Moody’s asset allocation efficient frontier, see below.

We’ll look at how some of the latest technology solutions from Synaptic can help you accelerate your transformation journey and give a competitive advantage. The state of play The general level of IT and integration of systems available to adviser firms is considered to be poor in relation to other sectors. The 2019 Report: ‘A Disconnected World’ (the lang cat & Origo), indicated that a typical compliant journey of an advice-based recommendation ‘may require data to be re-keyed 5 or 6 times’. That is neither efficient, nor a satisfying way to be doing business on a day to say basis. To help address this egregious drag on firms’ efficiency, Synaptic has seen an opportunity to build a suite of APIs. These APIs can enable direct integration into existing systems and process – giving the opportunity to create seamless software journeys rather than forcing advisers through a hotchpotch of unconnected services. Alongside these factors, the trend is towards consolidation in the adviser market – that means mergers continuing but on a scale we’ve not seen before. Anyone who has been through this process knows that two ‘wrong’ technology systems do not make a ‘right’ and that poor quality data equals a poor quality advice journey. Finding a technology partner to help level that playing field and give high quality data in an easy-to- digest format is difficult, but that’s something Synaptic can help with. What’s next? Improved use of data and integrated services could unleash the potential of your organisation to use technology effectively and get the best from your staff. Synaptic data and services via the new Pathways API suite can help your organisation respond to the stringent requirements of MiFID II in a more agile and flexible way. Synaptic plays an important role in financial services, collating platform, product and fund data for use by advisers and combining this with highly sophisticated modelling and calculations – now all wrapped up in APIs ready for integration with existing systems and processes. Synaptic provides the point-of-access for: • the market leading stochastic risk model and projections engine from Moody’s Analytics risk management for retail investors; • the industry’s leading costs and charges calculator (Comparator); • access to the world of Product and Fund data from the Synaptic research team; • standard MiFID II compliant cost and charges disclosure data; • new and comprehensive database of MPS and IDD portfolio (as well as product) data; • ability to request ex-ante illustration reporting wrapping up risk, projection, costs and charges, fund information and MiFID disclosure data A unique characteristic of Synaptic’s research methodology is collaboration with providers to obtain and verify data in the systems. This has created a high level of trust and reliance in Synaptic. The industry is changing with trends including the conglomeration of advice businesses and the emergence of ‘vertical’ integration’ as business models. Regulation intended to make advice more accountable to customers, and more professional, is increasing the reliance on technology, as greater efficiencies and transparency becomes more critical with larger groups of advisers being created. SYNAPTIC Connection Magazine  "," The historic lack of integration and technological advancement within the industry is being challenged, and new technology is coming to the fore; whether with a new Salesforce CRM complemented by Synaptic ex-ante illustrations, stochastic modelling or creation of risk-rated model portfolios. Advisers and their customers expect the professional tools they depend on to be fit- for-purpose in the 21st century. Synaptic has made its data and service assets available via API for 3rd parties to adopt into whatever technical framework they wish – that is the interoperability that is now required to move away from the disconnected world. This is facilitating a new age of technological innovation and progress, where systems can develop faster with the components that are required, detaching themselves from monolithic IT systems. Synaptic data and services can now become agile components within organisations, enabling them to strive for greater functionality and ultimately reliance on systems that can deliver much better value for shareholders, advisers and customers. MiFID II, IDD and discretionary MPS due diligence Synaptic APIs deliver data and services – separately or combining to facilitate MiFID II compliant reporting (ex- ante or ex-post). A key development within the Synaptic suite is the availability of data on a wide range of IDD and discretionary MPS portfolios, enabling illustrations (including ex-post and ex-ante), full charging analysis and disclosure of costs, and full, model-driven (Moody’s) risk profiling. About Synaptic data Providing product data to the industry for over 20 years, Synaptic methodology is unique as it requires providers to verify and sign off data, ensuring accuracy. The following is an example of the kind of providers and products available for research within the Synaptic research tool-set.  The following is a list of the principle APIs available from Synaptic People familiar with Synaptic tools will recognise the product terminology, but these are now brought to life as a set of distinct APIs with a huge amount of data, knowledge and skill all hidden away behind the scenes. Modeller, Comparator, Product & Fund and Analyser now exist as functional APIs that can help ‘power-up’ your existing systems. Added to that, in the new Pathways product, are illustration and suitability tooling to help you on your MiFID II compliance journey for both ex-ante and ex-post requirements. Ex-ante illustration API will return an illustration of costs and charges, risk and MiFID II disclosure for a given on or off platform product including funds, growth and charge data to produce a new business illustration. Product and Fund Data API will return a host of provider, product and fund data helping support high quality back-office data, portfolio builder services and product/platform/fund support. Modeller API – Risk and Projection Risk: will return a risk profile of a given investment based on underlying asset allocations. Projection: will return the probable outcome of a given investment, or will solve contributions required to meet an investment goal. Comparator API – Reduction in Yield (RIY) Illustration will return an RIY calculation, to illustrate the effect of enhanced costs and charges applied and overall reduction in yield (for total solutions cost). Fund Fact Sheet API will return a product or fund fact sheet as part of research process in PDF or HTML format. Ex-post illustration API will procure a valuation for a holding and risk rate the current position of that holding for review purposes, including fund target market data, to allow the disclosure of costs and charges for compliance purposes.   “These APIs can enable direct integration into existing systems and process – giving the opportunity to create seamless software journeys rather than forcing advisers through a hotchpotch of unconnected services.”   If your organisation could benefit from the integration of Synaptic data and services, please call us to discuss on 0800 783 4477.
