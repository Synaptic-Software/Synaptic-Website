You will notice a change of branding around this publication which in turn reflects our evolution as a business. Our life as a company began nearly ten years ago, as part of a project that the Capita Life and Pensions division were working on at the time.<br/>The unit that became Capita Financial Software, has since been encouraged<br/>to develop its role in line with our core capabilities. The business thrives on the foundation laid through the purchase of three leading IFA technology businesses; Quay Software,SynapticandWebline. Having shaped one of the most capable software development capabilities in our sector, our current purpose is not only to maintain and improve our estate of adviser tools, but to develop new solutions.<br/>The latter includes the Synaptic Comparator and Synaptic Modeller tools; two leading due-diligence tools offering market leading investment cost and risk analysis, at a time that the regulator is pushing for higher standards of advice across the board.<br/>Linked to the fact that Synaptic research systems have been used by advisers for 21 years, I have made the move to operate our business under this strong and trusted brand. Our new era begins now with the creation<br/>of Synaptic Software Limited as our single company entity, responsible for research, back office and portal services, for our 10,000 adviser subscribers (and those that have not yet become a client).<br/>There are two elements of the Synaptic proposition that I wish to highlight at this time:<br/>Cover Me Now – an initiative that offers instant, guaranteed premiums to Protection seekers by answering just 12 medical questions – see inside for more information; and secondly,<br/>Synaptic Risk – this proposition is now being made free for all, to allow a more robust assessment of client and investment risk – the perfect accompaniment to the research that our customers are conducting in Synaptic ‘Product and Fund’ and ‘Modeller’.

Not all multi-asset funds are created equal. Every extra pound paid in charges today can have a significant impact on the long-term growth of their savings.<br/>Are you considering all costs?<br/>The Retail Distribution Review (RDR)<br/>has served to make advisers and clients increasingly aware of how higher charges can weigh on long-term investment performance. Indeed, traditional ways of measuring costs, such as the Annual Management Charge (AMC), barely scratch the surface when it comes to providing a true reflection of the cost to the end consumer.<br/>The Total Expense Ratio (TER) and the more recent Ongoing Charges Figure (OCF) are<br/>more accurate measures of total costs and include items such as legal, custody and audit fees. However, even these measures only cover headline investment costs and do not capture the total cost of investing.When analysing a multi-<br/>asset fund, for example, investors may also wish to consider fund costs in three other areas:<br/>• the turnover costs of changing the funds held<br/>• the trading costs within the underlying funds<br/>• the cost of any derivatives exposure.<br/>Turnover costs of changing underlying funds<br/>Trading costs are the most obvious example of costs that are not captured by the AMC, TER or OCF. While it is difficult to obtain precise figures as fund turnover varies over time and from one manager to another, we believe<br/>that these are important costs to consider. Switching exposure between asset classes or markets, for example by switching from UK to European equities, is one of the main ways that managers aim to add incremental returns.<br/>Even the most effective active manager won’t be right with every trade, but each trade does<br/>incur transaction costs. These transaction<br/>costs are based on the difference between<br/>the buying and selling prices of investments (known as the ‘bid / offer spread’). Where actively-managed funds are bought as part of the overall multi-asset fund, it is also likely that there will be occasional costs from switching assets from one manager to another.<br/>A multi-asset fund that uses inexpensive, in-house passive funds avoids the majority of these costs, and is therefore likely to incur significantly lower costs than one using external active funds or Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs).<br/>Turnover costs within underlying funds<br/>The funds held within a multi-asset fund<br/>also incur transaction costs. While both index and active funds incur these costs, they are typically much higher for active funds, as the managers change their views over time. For example, a FTSE All World Index fund may turn over around 3% of holdings, while for a typical<br/>","5<br/>Not all multi-asset funds are created equal. Every extra pound paid in charges today can have a significant impact on the long-term growth of their savings<br/>active fund this can be expected to be as high as 100%. This implies a considerable saving for multi-asset funds using index tracker funds for their underlying investment exposure.<br/>Paying for the flexibility of derivatives<br/>Some multi-asset funds use derivatives to take shorter-term positions that might be very expensive to undertake with physical assets. While derivatives can provide this important<br/>and useful flexibility, they can create significant additional costs. Multi-asset funds can make use of both exchange-traded and over-the- counter derivatives such as futures, options and total return swaps (TRS).<br/>For example, exposure gained through futures and TRS tend to give a slightly lower return than the equivalent holding in the underlying asset. This is because of the charges levied by banks for providing them. These funding charges consist of<br/>the derivative funding cost, as well as the difference between the cost of the three- month cash rate (on which futures are based) and the lower cost of the one-week cash rate (against which most cash funds are benchmarked). There can also be costs relating to the clearing, execution and margin-interest costs associated with the use of derivatives.<br/>When taking shorter-term positions it may still be more efficient to use derivatives<br/>than physical assets, due to lower initial trading costs in many cases. However, it is important to note the implied cost of assessing alternative strategies.<br/>Making an informed investment decision<br/>The combination of headline costs included in the TER and underlying trading and derivative costs can have a major impact on returns<br/>received by a multi-asset investor over the long run. However, the presence of ‘hidden’ costs can make it difficult to assess the total costs<br/>of a multi-asset fund, particularly where more complex strategies are involved. The benefits of these strategies are often well articulated, but the costs are often overlooked.<br/>Assessing a manager’s ability to generate returns and manage risk is clearly central to fund selection. When doing the due diligence research on a given fund for your clients, however, it is also crucial to take an in-depth look at all of the costs incurred in executing a fund manager’s strategy.<br/>This is not a consumer advertisement.

Use market-cap weighted funds<br/>The distinction between required and desired returns also informs underlying fund choice. If we are using a given split of assets to target a required return, it makes sense to remove as many layers of uncertainty from that return as possible.<br/>A market-cap weighted approach provides the purest asset class exposure. Conversely, active management deliberately skews a portfolio away from the market return. Sometimes an active manager will outperform, sometimes they won’t, and the adviser and client have<br/>no control over this outcome. As such, active management introduces greater uncertainty to returns.<br/>Multi-asset funds built from passive underlying portfolios remove this uncertainty by providing pure asset class returns, with the added benefits of being typically more diversified and lower-cost than their active equivalents.<br/>4. Stick to core asset classes<br/>In addition to the core asset classes of equities, bonds and cash, some multi-asset funds include property, commodities, hedge funds and even more esoteric investments. The argument is that these additions provide diversification benefits that lead to better risk-adjusted returns. However, a closer look at these exposures throws up some questions.<br/>But the multi-asset fund arena is a potentially confusing space, with lots of competing approaches and different levels of product complexity. At Vanguard, we think that focusing on five simple principles can help advisers to select the right product for their clients.<br/>1. Minimise costs<br/>Many investors spend a disproportionate amount of time trying to identify outperforming funds. But by definition, half of all investments underperform the benchmark before costs. After costs, more than half underperform - and the higher the costs, the higher the chance of underperformance.<br/>Vanguard’s analysis shows that cost is one of the most accurate predictors of performance, with low-cost funds outperforming high-cost funds in nine out of 11 sectors1. So the first step is to choose a low-cost fund that allows your clients to keep more of their investment returns.<br/>2. Allocate your assets strategically<br/>Tactical asset allocation - trying to add value by moving in and out of different asset classes - is an appealing strategy in theory. In practice, however, market rotations happen quickly and are difficult to predict, making it hard to add value through timing markets. And secondly, trading in and out of different assets generates costs, creating a performance hurdle that many funds fail to clear.<br/>At Vanguard we believe goals-based financial planning is better served by strategic asset allocation: setting appropriate weightings<br/>in core asset classes and then resisting the temptation to tinker. This approach is well suited to advisers who are targeting a required return to help their clients reach their goals, rather than seeking to maximise returns at<br/>all costs - an approach that can easily expose clients to unknown and unwanted risks.<br/>","7<br/>Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus<br/>How significant are the weightings in these gradually assume a higher equity weighting,<br/>Important notes<br/>T<br/>assets?

The value of investments, and the income from them, may fall or rise<br/>laudantium<br/>As well as keeping the risk and return characteristics of the portfolio on track, rebalancing back to the agreed breakdown has two further benefits. It helps to keep client conversations tethered to their long-term goals; and it involves automatically selling high and buying low - a proven route to investing success, but one that most investors find difficult to stick to in practice.<br/>Rebalancing should be done regularly enough to ensure that the portfolio doesn’t drift<br/>too far, but not so often that it generates unnecessarily high trading costs. Once or twice a year is normally adequate.<br/>In summary, when selecting multi-asset portfolios Vanguard believes that advisers should consider using a solution based<br/>on low-cost, market-cap weighted funds. Strategic asset allocation is a cost-effective way of helping clients to reach their goals,<br/>with allocations to equities, bonds and cash providing ample diversification for most clients. And finally, it is important to ensure that the portfolio is regularly rebalanced to its target allocations so that it continues to deliver the agreed risk and return characteristics.<br/>and investors may get back less than they invested.

Sectors assessed: emerging market equity, EUR diversified bond, European equity, Eurozone equity, GBP diversified bond, GBP government bond, global bond, global equity, UK equity, US equity and USD diversified bond. All mutual funds in each Morningstar category were ranked by their expense ratios as of 31 December 2013. They were then divided into four equal groups, from the lowest-cost to the highest-cost funds. The ten-year annualised returns for the median funds in the lowest cost and highest cost quartiles were compared and, in all except the European equity and GBP diversified bond sectors, the lowest-cost medians outperformed the highest-cost medians. Returns are in sterling terms with income reinvested, net of expenses, excluding loads and taxes. Both actively managed and indexed funds are included. For funds with both income and accumulation share classes, we use only accumulation share classes to avoid double counting. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results.<br/>The NACUBO-Commonfund survey in the<br/>US provides an interesting insight into these questions. It measures the performance of US endowment funds, many of which employ highly complex strategies including exposure to a range of esoteric assets. As you can see in Figure 1, this added complexity doesn’t create any obvious performance advantage over a straightforward 60/40 equity and bond portfolio.<br/>Vanguard’s view is that a straightforward portfolio of equities, bonds and cash provides ample diversification for the majority of investors - especially when you bear in mind that the equity weighting also provides some indirect exposure to property and commodities.<br/>5.

You may still need alternative options outside your CIP for those clients with more specific needs.<br/>Typically, it includes a standardised risk<br/>profile questionnaire together with a range<br/>of investment solutions linked to desired outcomes for that specific client. And while that sounds simple enough - that is where the simplicity ends.<br/>In the current market, there are a whole host of tools and services on offer to support the CIP creation process as well as relatively clear<br/>","guidelines set out by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The regulator says that a standardised investment approach should not be used as a one-size-fits-all solution and that firms should be careful not to shoe-horn clients.<br/>For advisers who do want to look at outsourcing their investment solution as part of their CIP - there are two main options; model portfolios and discretionary managed services.<br/>Advisers have typically tended to gravitate towards using a multi-manager or multi-asset fund for clients with smaller pots - but look to discretionary fund managers when faced with a more high-net worth client.<br/>Lately however, studies have found that growing numbers of advisers are turning to discretionary fund managers as an investment solution for medium- and high- net-worth clients.<br/>DFMs take the burden of ongoing management away from the adviser and can be offered by platforms, and a discretionary manager will actively manage the models ‘on platform’.<br/>While DFMs gain in popularity, the regulator has been voicing concerns that many advisers are disregarding the top-down approach in portfolio selection - recommending products based on their familiarity with them as opposed to selecting them based primarily on client needs. Some firms are opting to put the time and cost efficiency of the firm above suitability considerations in CIP creation.<br/>However, the regulator’s position is quite clear.When selecting a provider for CIPs, there should be two overriding consideration: due diligence in the selection process, and ultimately - the suitability of the products for the client.<br/>A recent study by CWC Research and the lang cat found that some advisers appeared to be falling short on FCA requirements, on things like - inability to cite the main charges on preferred funds, despite the availability of data<br/>providers and tools.<br/>The study found that advisers would too often recommend certain funds simply because<br/>the firm had track record of using them, not because they were always necessarily best suited to a particular client’s needs.<br/>But is that because advisers are increasingly squeezed for the time and resources needed to adequately asses the wealth of new products and providers hitting the market?<br/>How does an adviser determine the efficacy of one product or provider over another at a time when the market is still criticised for being rather opaque on costs?<br/>Questions like these go a long way to explain why FE Transmission, rolled out in March this year, has been so popular among the adviser community. The service, accessible to FE Analytics users, helps DFMs distribute model portfolio data and reports to any adviser in the UK.<br/>But more importantly - the service allows an adviser to stress-test a DFM for risk-suitability in a very time-efficient and accurate manner. The service allows advisers to integrate model portfolios into their due diligence, portfolio selection and reporting workflows. This has the added bonus of also producing highly- professional, glossy reports and goes a long way to help justify fees.<br/>Advisers also gain access to research tools, market data and comprehensive reporting - all of which helps the adviser provide better advice whilst establishing a robust investment process and of course an audit trail.<br/>There are currently around 9 DFM providers on FE Transmission - but that number is set to grow as more and more DFMs, and advisers alike, see the usefulness of the service.<br/>It is easy to imagine the fund provider community will be active in developing risk- targeted multi-asset solutions and tools over the coming years, advisers should note that in the end that there is no simple rule that will highlight to them which investment solution<br/>type is best suited for their client.<br/>This comes from the face-to-face time spent with the client themselves and thorough research of the solutions available. When using any outsourced investment solution, advisers need to make sure there is additional ongoing governance, review and rebalancing in place.<br/>Advisers should also note that the final guidance on ‘Assessing suitability: Replacement business and centralised investment propositions’ (FG12/16) from the regulator is a good place to help set parameters for the CIP creation process. The FCA clearly highlights examples of good and bad practice and just what concerns them.<br/>By using a CIP, you can effectively outsource the work involved in portfolio construction - freeing you up for the all-important client- facing tasks. This does not mean, however, that you are outsourcing the regulatory risk for selecting, constructing and executing the CIP in the first instance - that responsibility stays with you.<br/>More efficient operating model, yes, but fully outsourced regulatory risk, no, absolutely not.<br/>Contact details<br/>T / 020 7534 7661<br/>E / Tahmina.Mannan@financialexpress.net<br/>FE, 2nd Floor, Golden House,<br/>30 Great Pulteney Street, London, W1F 9NN United Kingdom<br/>www.financialexpress.net<br/>11<br/>","12<br/>M&G Multi Asset Team: Market Outlook<br/>Steve Andrew | Fund Manager | M&G Episode Income Fund<br/>Since our last update at the beginning of the second quarter, the key development in markets has been the return of volatility.<br/>underweight mainstream government bonds and overweight equities for some time.<br/>Fundamentals still encouraging<br/>So as we start the third quarter, what do we make of this volatility? Firstly, we believe it is always very important to make the distinction between volatility and risk.<br/>True risk is the potential for permanent capital loss, while volatility is simply the market’s varying opinion about where to mark the<br/>price for different assets and is often driven by sentiment and therefore temporary. As a result, we believe it is vital that we do not overreact to short-term volatility, and instead, use it<br/>as a time to check whether our longer term fundamentals-based convictions have changed. If not, volatility may present compelling investment opportunities.<br/>Overall, nothing has really changed in terms of the facts. European economic fundamentals, outside of Greece, are probably looking as strong as they have done for a good number of years (see figure 2 showing Purchasing Managers Indices (PMIs) in most areas indicating expansion, ie, a reading above 50).<br/>In Germany, corporate profitability is going from strength to strength, and even in the periphery, Italian and Spanish macroeconomic data are improving.We are also starting to see<br/>Figure 1: Increased volatility across asset classes<br/>Source: Datastream, 9 July 2015.<br/>For us it is vital that, as all kinds of headlines come and go, and the market environment gets rather ‘noisy’ and volatile, we keep our eyes on the risks with regard to interest rates and are ever mindful of the fundamental backdrop against which we are trading.<br/>Volatility returns<br/>The financial market in the second quarter of 2015 was a significantly more volatile place than the first three months of the year (see figure 1). The main issues grabbing investors’ attention during the first quarter are still with us: speculation over when the US Federal Reserve (the Fed) is going to raise interest rates and concerns about growth in the euro area, in particular.<br/>However, during the second quarter, these themes were overlaid with heightened uncertainty over the outlook for Greece, including the return of ‘Grexit’ fears. Since the end of the second quarter, we have also seen dramatic declines in Chinese equity markets. The triggers for this are not particularly easy to<br/>identify since Chinese equities had previously been rallying strongly, despite evidence of a slowdown in China for some months now, and the economy has not notably accelerated recently.<br/>Equity prices have pulled back pretty sharply from where they were in the first quarter. Bond prices have fallen significantly too and, in fact, more profoundly than equity prices. So the place to lose most money has been the bond market. That is consistent with what we have believed from a valuation perspective since<br/>the end of last year. Our portfolios have been<br/>","13<br/>The financial market in the second quarter of 2015 was a significantly more volatile place than the first three months of the year<br/>forward earnings beginning to improve, which, if it plays out, would be a big positive for equity markets.

Whereas on the bond side, we think there<br/>is still some distance to go before we are confident about adding to our bond exposure.<br/>Opportunities and challenges<br/>Investors today face an uncertain environment. We have just experienced an extraordinary phase in financial markets. Investors remain rattled by the shock of 2008 and this has meaningfully skewed investors’ perceptions<br/>of risk. Coupled with the unprecedented intervention of central bankers in recent<br/>years - and the potentially huge disruption the removal of this intervention could cause - this leaves asset pricing still significantly distorted.<br/>In our view, many areas of mainstream government bond markets currently remain unattractive, offering extremely low levels of yield that mean previous ‘safe havens’ may now look rather risky. Meanwhile, despite the strong performance of equities in the past couple of years, in many areas, risk premiums are still over-compensating as investors continue to struggle to weigh evidence of slowly improving fundamentals against their recent painful experience.<br/>All of this means we find ourselves in an environment that appears unstable, with a great deal of focus on what policymakers will do next, particularly in terms of the historically low cash rates that have affected asset prices across the global investment universe.<br/>Figure 2: Improving European PMIs<br/>Source: Datastream, 1 July 2015<br/>In our view, many areas of mainstream government bond markets currently remain unattractive, offering extremely low levels of yield that mean previous ‘safe havens’ may now look rather risky.<br/>Meanwhile, the US and UK economies continue to make good progress. There is very little concern around inflation; at the same time, worries around deflation appear to have subsided.We are also seeing some modest wage growth. In Asia, there are ongoing worries around China, and price responses have been punchy, so this is something that we are watching closely.<br/>The conclusion is that the global macroeconomic backdrop looks pretty benign but there has been an increase in volatility, which we view as a fertile environment for investment opportunities.<br/>The recent move in bonds has been much more meaningful than the move in equities. Therefore, while equity market volatility may unsettle the stomach from time to time, we would see these incidences more as<br/>The challenge for investors is still the attempts at interpreting what the Fed is going to do. We cannot know for sure when the Fed will raise rates, but we know that it is coming at some point in the not-too-distant future. And that will be a test for bond prices, in particular, as<br/>it pertains not just to US assets, but to global assets. As asset allocators, navigating through that will be critical. Two areas we think could offer a useful hedge against the Fed’s interest rate rise are US banks and the US dollar.<br/>Therefore, investors should expect a great deal of short-term volatility, but also be prepared for the opportunities this could present. That is why genuinely and carefully diversified multi- asset funds that have the flexibility to respond to quickly changing environments could be best positioned to navigate the turbulence ahead.<br/>","14<br/>Passive Fund War? What War?<br/>Abraham Okusanya | Principal | FinalytiQ<br/>If we are to believe the media, there<br/>is price war raging between index fund providers.<br/>And so one of the key focus of our Evolution of Passive & Strategic Beta Investing Report was to see if there’s any truth to this; we are looking at, among other things, how pricing is influencing fund flow into passive funds.The cold hard data suggest something far short of a full-blown war; something closer to a friendly fistfight. For instance, only 3 of 25 FTSE All Share index funds have an OCF below 0.10%. The so-called ‘passive war’ at least in the OEIC/ UT space, is actually only being significantly driven by 3 dominant players; Fidelity, LGIM and Vanguard. But some of the largest FTSE All Share index funds including BlackRock, HSBC and Scottish Widows have relatively high<br/>OCF and are charging more than 100% more when compared to the lowest priced funds by Vanguard and Fidelity.<br/>We see some indication that investors are moving out expensive index funds into the cheaper funds but not necessarily in droves.<br/>Data as at June 2015.

Both providers offered super clean share classes to a select number<br/>of platforms. But there is little indication that this in itself is having a meaning impact on flows - over the last 12 months, inflows to L&G trackers has been particularly dire. Fidelity is fairing much better, probably because it<br/>has a greater influence on distribution via its own platform. This highlights the vital role<br/>that distribution channels play; BlackRock prices competitively for institutional investors, Vanguard is more keenly priced for retail<br/>and advisory clients. Scottish Widows is an interesting case of how vital distribution channels are; the £9billion tracker funds is among the most expensive and one would expect existing investors to vote with their feet. There is little sign of that happening, probably because much of the flow to the fund is via the providers own pension product range.<br/>Ripe for Consolidation?<br/>While the competition is not actually as intense as the media might suggest, there is just no way that so many funds doing exactly the same thing (albeit to varying degree of accuracy) are going to survive. Over the next<br/>few years, we hope to see the back of sub-scale funds in this space; i.e funds with less than £200M asset size, they tend to be expensive, lack the scale and inflow needed to cut prices; they tend to do indexing very badly and<br/>they have no complimentary product range. Yes, Scottish Mutual, Henderson, Chariguard, Allianz, we are looking at you!<br/>There is a huge potential for consolidation in this space - we are taking fund mergers rather than provider merger. We think (and sincerely hope) some providers should simply put up their hands and admit that they can’t make this work. One possibility is for the Vanguards, Fidelity’s and L&G to take over these funds, but I’m sure no one at their padded City offices<br/>are thinking about that just yet. Merging these laggards into larger index funds is good for<br/>the providers and for clients. It helps existing provider get rid of failing business stream that has no future whatsoever, for the provider taking over the funds, the acquisition (if any) is probably lower than going off to acquire new customers and for investors, this invariable means lower fees and better products.<br/>And then there are big funds whose clients don’t benefit from the economy of scale that they should; Scottish Widows, Virgin and Halifax are the worse.<br/>In spite of the popular view that the US market being perhaps the most efficient equity market in the world, lending itself to greater use of index funds, this sector is lacking in action in terms of product range and flow. There is a lot more action in the ETF space than the OEICs/ UT. The lack of variety - small cap, value and smart beta products in this particular market is noticeable.<br/>The conclusion we draw is that competition between passive fund providers fell far short<br/>of a full blown war, but winners and looser<br/>are beginning to emerge. Overall, our research across 10 asset classes shows BlackRock, Vanguard and Fidelity emerging as winners and L&G and HBSC are falling behind.<br/>","16<br/>Talking the Same Language<br/>Paul Wood | Best Advice Software Manager | Platform Development & E-Commerce | Aviva Life & Pensions<br/>Risk is a fickle mistress, both punishing and rewarding to those that take it. It’s what drives the thrill for some and makes others turn away.<br/>A decision made in a risky situation can<br/>make you look a star or wish the ground would swallow you up. The Lionesses recent performance in the Women’s World Cup in Canada demonstrates that nicely; they out- performed expectations, but a moment lead to a stretch too far and brought their campaign crashing down. Had Laura Bassett looked up to see what was around her she might well have made a different decision, changing the course of the match and possibly the campaign. Or<br/>if her foot had been an inch in any direction to where it was, she would’ve been hailed as a hero (as ultimately all of the women in the team quite rightfully were).<br/>Our industry is no different, it is centred on risk, and how to either minimise its impacts or maximize its opportunities. Information, knowledge and interpretation of the situation in front of you are what determine the quality of the outcome, the advice. The difference<br/>is that a typical client can understand that<br/>walking a tightrope might lead to a fall, but investment risk, the impact of inflation on their savings and even their own mortality are concepts they often struggle to comprehend.<br/>We in the industry and our commentators often don’t help. Even house price inflation,<br/>a subject most adults are familiar with, is not put into ‘real terms’, even though it can impact a homeowner to the tune of thousands of pounds a year. Every year. For the rest of their lives. A few years back a friend of mine point blank refused to accept that selling their home for 16% more than they sold it for wasn’t really a profit as RPI had risen by 18% over<br/>the period they owned the property. That the original purchase price wasn’t worth what it was at the time of the conversation was in their mind entirely beside the point. What we did agree on was the view over the Yorkshire Wolds we had at the time was a more interesting subject and moved on.<br/>But therein lies the problem: there will always be something more interesting to take our attention elsewhere.<br/>Investing is a complex subject. Identifying the most tax efficient product, attitude to risk, capacity for loss, the correct portfolio of funds with the client in mind, and the cheapest route are areas in which an adviser is spoilt for choice for tools, not least by Capita’s range. They all produce reports of varying detail. And graphs, lots of graphs.<br/>These tools help demonstrate certain aspects of research very well. But the notion of holistic research is really a conglomeration of largely separate, disjointed processes. Anyone not using Capita’s suite of tools will have a lot of retyping and duplication of work, all of which involves time and effort. In all likelihood the amount of energy the researcher has at the start of the process is substantially higher than at the end, with inherent consequences for the<br/>","17<br/>Information, knowledge and interpretation of the situation in front of you are what determine the quality of the outcome, the advice<br/>quality of that research. The final product of that research is often aimed at the adviser and more to the point their compliance file. Not often enough is it intended to be used with the client, and rarely is it presented in a way that they will understand let alone be interested in.<br/>Small increases in cost compounding over time can lead to dramatic end consequences. The apparently negligible difference in costs can be significant when dealing with the timeframes common in retirement planning, timeframes clients rarely consider at any other time.<br/>The timing of investment returns is another crucial factor, in particular what has become known as ‘pound cost ravaging’. In essence this describes the impact of the order of the investment return cycle, rather than the scale of returns when an income is taken from an investment. Pension freedom has engaged clients with their pension holdings in a way never thought imaginable a couple of years ago. However with that comes responsibility for how their retirement is going to be funded. I’ll avoid the Italian supercar cliché but a dream holiday, wedding or university fees are all things that could realistically be funded through the new pension freedoms without the client fully understanding the consequences.<br/>Not ‘having to buy’ an annuity has led to a £1.8bn spending spree in two months, but that is a lot of money no longer supporting retirement. How many of those that have used the freedoms are aware, or care, how long their retirement may be? We’re back to risk, information and knowledge. Most small investors have little understanding of the pension industry. The balance of ISA holdings in cash against those in stocks and shares suggests they also are risk adverse. There is<br/>a plethora of information available to those willing to look for it. But how are those points being linked together? How many people understand that keeping their money in a<br/>pension rather than buying an annuity means they are retaining investment risk and altering the balance of mortality risk? Would they even know what that means? Small differences<br/>in the decisions at any stage can make substantial changes to the outcome, just like where Laura put her foot.<br/>We, the industry, can and should do more to explain these areas to the public in a way they will interact with. Holly Mackay’s new venture, BoringMoney.com, should be applauded for making a bold move towards this goal. People will engage in serious matters, it just has to<br/>be put in a way that ‘talks to them’, in their language. At Aviva, we’re developing a new educational service with the public in mind, not rehashing the normal industry jargon. If<br/>it helps people make an informed decision at the correct time for that decision to be made, the perception of our industry will improve, increasing the opportunities for provider, adviser and client.<br/>How many of those that have used the freedoms are aware, or care, how long their retirement may be? We’re back to risk, information and knowledge.<br/>","18<br/>The Challenges for Investing in a Low Rate World<br/>Graham O’Neill | Investment Director | Rayner Spencer Mills Research<br/>The current environment for investors is full of complex permutations, particularly if they are in or close to retirement.<br/>The low rates of interest available, inflation and importantly slow growth we are currently experiencing are all part of the same problem.<br/>The muted economic recovery has occurred despite the huge levels of monetary stimulus applied to the global economy. The exact effects of QE are hard to quantify as no one knows what state the world would have been in without it but one thing is for sure, QE has not yet led to inflation and in the short term inflationary pressures look likely to remain muted as there is very little wage growth in the developed world. Ultra low interest rates are a consequence of the contractionary forces in the world economy today, and historically low levels of both short and long term interest rates look likely to remain for some time.<br/>Low long term rates reflect deflation fears, despite the efforts of Central Banks. In many countries real rates are negative which makes it ever harder for investors to generate returns in an era of a savings glut. The actions of Central<br/>Banks mean the generation of safe income<br/>is now impossible and some investors are, perhaps unwisely, chasing a lot of risk in search of higher returns.<br/>So far everything about the global economy suggests the recovery will remain subdued and that interest rate increases, when they occur, will both be shallow and at a relatively slow pace compared to previous upturns. Economies such as the US and UK cannot afford rapid rate rises as deleveraging has not occurred fast enough. Within Europe the duration of the QE programme is uncertain but will last at least until 2016, so prospects for actual interest rate rises must be many years away.<br/>Investors who want income have therefore sought out higher risk options to help them achieve their income requirements, in many cases using equities for the first time, giving a liquidity boost to markets around the world and helping them rise to new highs over the last few years. But what can we expect from<br/>markets that look fairly highly valued already as we look into the second half of 2015 and beyond?<br/>Global debt levels are still very high which will constrain levels of growth which means that<br/>in the short run, a rout in the bond markets seems unlikely. The low level of absolute yields in government bonds is forcing investors into corporate credit, particularly investment grade. The economic background for credit remains favourable with muted economic growth not encouraging excessive risk taking by corporates, whilst balance sheets often remain better than at the government or individual level.<br/>The bad news for investors is that markets have front run the economic improvement, meaning share ratings are high for this stage of the economic cycle. After recent gains there is even more need for earnings growth to validate current market levels - this is looking more difficult in the States where estimates for second quarter earnings are negative and<br/>","19<br/>The muted economic recovery has occurred despite the huge levels of monetary stimulus applied to the global economy<br/>the full year 2015 outcome is unlikely to see earnings grow by much more than 5% at best. So far in 2015 Europe, Asia and Japan have performed relatively well, whilst the weakness in commodity prices impacted negatively on many non-Asian emerging markets.<br/>This is an extremely difficult environment<br/>for many investors because the actions of Central Banks today have resulted in never before seen levels of government bond yields,<br/>which is causing valuation distortions of all financial assets, not just government bonds, but also equities and property. Equities can justify a high level of valuation while interest rates remain so close to zero and the hunt for yield and return is forcing some investors into higher risk assets than they are naturally suited to. Any reversal of easy monetary policy by a significant degree could lead to these investors heading for the exit all at once. Longer term valuation is the best form of risk control and<br/>one of the major worries for global equities<br/>is that the world’s principle market, the US, is now expensive when looking either at cyclically adjusted or median stock PE ratios.<br/>Whilst the exact course of monetary<br/>policy remains uncertain, the global economic recovery looks likely to continue. Accommodative Central Bank policy could lead to an extended business cycle, perhaps of a decade. This has been anticipated to some<br/>degree by investors, which is why market gains have front run economic gains. Within fixed interest, the current economic environment continues to favour high quality corporate credit and there remains potential for further spread tightening in this asset class.<br/>Overall investors should continue to hold<br/>a diversified portfolio - the unprecedented market environment makes it difficult to understand which asset classes would respond<br/>more negatively to, for example, monetary tightening. After the run up in equity market valuations it is possible that equities could suffer more than bonds in a sell off over the shorter term at least. The equity markets with the best potential are those where profits versus previous peaks remain depressed - Europe, Asia and Japan - and these are the areas where investors should be overweight. The US market has underperformed for the first time since the 2009 rally as investors have concerns over the impact of a strong Dollar on US company earnings. US equities are likely to lag a positive economic environment as this market has seen a significant re-valuation since its trough. Careful fund selection rather than market beta is likely to be the most important driver of returns over the next 12 months.<br/>A diversified portfolio of equity funds, well managed strategic bond portfolios and certain absolute return funds still have the potential to outperform cash.<br/>The equity markets with the best potential are those where profits versus previous peaks remain depressed - Europe, Asia<br/>and Japan<br/>","20<br/>Metal Madness<br/>Ben Kumar | Investment Manager | Seven Investment Management<br/>Have you ever considered investing in Antimony, Cadmium or Zirconium?<br/>Could you identify which was which out of a collection of similar looking lumps of metal? Would you even be interested in doing so?<br/>I suspect for most investors the answer to all three questions above is a “no” - and a fairly disinterested one at that. However if you could achieve the long-held dream of alchemists and add a few extra electrons, protons and neutrons to the above metals, you’d end up with gold. Now that’s a metal that gets investors excited.<br/>Yet arguably the first three names should be at least as important to you. There is five times more zirconium in your body than there is gold. Ten times more antimony than gold. 250 times more cadmium than gold. (I could go on listing obscure chemical elements that outweigh gold, but it might get a touch boring.) In addition, the tiny trace amount of gold present in our bodies<br/>seems to have no particular function - we certainly don’t need it in the same way as we need oxygen.<br/>Why then is there this fascination with the yellow metal? Why is it so overrated in comparison to its actual importance to our continued existence? Should it really be treated with such reverence as an investment?<br/>The historic context sheds some light. Over the last few millennia gold was used as a means to exchange nominal values of goods without exchanging the goods themselves. In many respects gold is a natural choice to act as coinage - rare, but not unobtainable, and with no harmful effects. Other materials could also have been used; silk and saffron spring to mind as scarce commodities, but would perhaps have been harder to transport efficiently. Through the centuries though,<br/>Over the last few millennia gold was used as a means to exchange nominal values of goods without exchanging the goods themselves<br/>","21<br/>There are fierce defenders of the protection that gold can offer in times of financial crisis and market volatility<br/>the role of gold as part of the currency diminished, as non-gold coins and letters<br/>of credit began to proliferate. In the current era, gold’s relation to money has completely vanished - the financial world has moved on to ‘fiat money’ (currency that a government has declared to be legal tender, but is not backed by a physical commodity), mainly stored in cyberspace.<br/>Ask someone in the street to be paid in<br/>gold and you’ll get a very funny look. Yet bizarrely, in the investment world (which has embraced fiat money with aplomb), gold still<br/>has its place. Investors set aside a portion of their asset allocation for it, and there<br/>are fierce defenders of the protection that gold can offer in times of financial crisis and market volatility.<br/>This ‘safe haven’ argument is relatively weak to my eyes. Without an explicit connection to a currency, holding gold is the same from a financial perspective, as owning any other asset. Valuing assets is quite easy (in general terms - the specifics are the reason analysts exist in such numbers!). For an equity, the value is in owning a part of a company and its future growth. For a bond, it is about how much a fixed stream of cash is worth, adjusted for risk. Even commodities such<br/>as energy or food can be priced by the end demand for them - they are necessary for either industry or life.<br/>Gold though has zero potential earnings, no stream of cash flows and minimal industrial use. There is of course demand from the fashion industry, but it tends to be fickle and erratic. The only real price determinant is how much the person you sell to will pay -<br/>the ‘greater fool’ theory. That doesn’t strike me as attractive, however you cut it.<br/>One last thought. For gold to truly be a safe haven, one has to believe that if the world ends, it will become the means of exchange once more. I’d still argue for owning canned food and bottled water before an inert lump of metal. Plus, if you own gold through any financial instrument (ie. don’t just have it tucked under your bed), you’ll do well to exercise your claim to ownership in the aftermath of some kind of apocalypse...<br/>This ‘safe haven’ argument is relatively weak<br/>to my eyes.Without an explicit connection<br/>to a currency, holding gold is the same from a financial perspective, as owning any other asset<br/>","22<br/>Pension Freedoms - So Far So Good?<br/>Jamie Clark | Business Development Manager | Royal London<br/>Now that we are a few months into a new pensions regime and our new Pensions Minister is officially in office, let’s pause for a moment and see how it all has gone so far.<br/>In general, the national press were covering the new freedoms with a positive slant just before and just after they came into force on 6 April. But since then there have been various stories about how people are being prevented from getting their hands on their money, or can’t take advantage of flexible access drawdown.<br/>One reason for this is that the FCA and The Pensions Regulator have put in place rules and regulations designed to prevent people making bad decisions that could see them at a financial disadvantage. But there are other reasons too.<br/>In the case of trust-based schemes, research from Sackers1 suggests that while 67%<br/>of schemes surveyed would offer the new flexibilities to members, only 14% will offer flexible access drawdown (FAD). However 94% would offer an uncrystallised fund lump sum (UFPLS). What that means is that most trust- based DC schemes will only offer UFPLS and members who want to take advantage of FAD will have to transfer out.<br/>So at the moment, it seems that there is little appetite among trustees to offer full flexibility. This might be because of the cost of creating and implementing systems to allow full flexibility. It might be a lack of<br/>third party solutions available. Or it might<br/>be that the regulatory risk is too great. All this is understandable as it’s still early days. But perhaps now that NEST have published their “retirement income blueprint”2 for their members, new solutions and innovations will come to market that all trustees can use.<br/>There are similar issues when it comes to contract-based schemes. Some (especially older) contracts might not be held on a system that can cope with full flexibility. Changing<br/>the system might cost too much, so the only option available might be UFPLS, or a transfer to a plan that can offer full flexibility.<br/>Other issues include guaranteed annuity options. Where the policy value is more than £30,000, advice will be required before either UFPLS or a transfer can be taken but many people might not want to take advice either because they think they don’t need it, or they think it costs too much. In cases like this, maybe PensionWise could step up and provide suitable guidance.<br/>There is little doubt that the new pension freedoms are a good thing. But there is still a long way to go in making sure that the people who want to take advantage of them can do so at a reasonable cost while protecting them against detrimental decisions. That’s why we will continue to work with the industry and government to do just that. After all, it’s in all our best interests to do so.<br/>Sources:<br/>1 Sackers - Flexibilities survey results, May 2015<br/>2 NEST - A retirement income blueprint for NEST’s members, June 2015<br/>","PENSION FREEDOM<br/>ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES<br/>The new pension laws open a world of opportunity and choice for your clients.

In April 2014, the chancellor announced that people would have greater flexibility when taking their pensions funds.<br/>that what people are really looking for is greater levels of flexibility in terms of what they do with their pension pots.<br/>Research commissioned by Retirement Advantage last autumn gave an indication of what people are currently looking for from pension products. “We spoke to customers and advisers, and found that while customers like the idea of guaranteed income, they<br/>are also looking for flexibility - and for the ability to pass funds on to their family after death,” says Tully. “In other words, they<br/>want to have it all.” The survey found that ‘Ensuring you have the flexibility to do what you want with your money, when you want to’ was viewed as important by 75% of those polled, compared to 66% who cited having a guaranteed income in retirement.<br/>This demand for flexibility is likely to<br/>give rise to greater levels of innovation in the market - and new types of product<br/>are already beginning to take shape. In particular, with flexibility rising to the fore as a priority for customers, pensions providers are starting to look at blended offerings which will give customers the benefits of both annuities and drawdowns - rather than forcing customers to choose between the two options.<br/>These changes came into effect in April 2015 and have already prompted many retirees to reconsider their retirement choices.<br/>In the past, the pensions market was effectively split between two options. “On the one hand, around 80% of the market traditionally bought an annuity,” explains Andrew Tully, pensions technical director at Retirement Advantage. “Annuities bring the huge advantage of a guaranteed income for life - but on the downside, there is a lack of flexibility if a person’s circumstances change. At the same time, there is little benefit upon death to the person’s family.”<br/>The other option, chosen by the remaining 20% of the market, was to take an income drawdown. “This offered fantastic flexibility: it allows income to go up and down, and the death benefits are good,” says Tully. “But the<br/>downside is that the retiree could run out of money, making this a much higher risk proposition.”<br/>Between these two extremes, there were few products offering customers the benefits of both - but the changes announced in April 2014 have given people a new freedom to use their cash as they choose. In the year following the announcement, the retirement market shrunk from more than £13 billion to around £8.5 billion as people waited for the new rules to come into effect - suggesting that neither annuities nor drawdowns had really been fulfilling everyone’s needs.<br/>Since the rules came into effect in April 2015, many people have chosen to take all of their pension fund in one go. However, this may not be the most tax-efficient choice - and it is becoming increasingly clear<br/>","25<br/>Summary: In the past, most retirees had to make a choice between an annuity or income drawdown when deciding how to spend their pension pots - but this is about to change. Pension reforms announced by George Osborne last year are stoking demand for more flexible products - and this, in turn, is prompting providers to create innovative, blended solutions.<br/>“In theory, an adviser could just buy an annuity with half of the money and buy a drawdown with the other half,” says Tully. “But that would mean double the work for the adviser, while the customer is left with their money spread between two different places. Nor does that really provide the flexibility that people are looking for -<br/>the customer wouldn’t be able to switch some or all of their income on and off, for example.”<br/>allocations to be adjusted over time as the retiree’s circumstances change.<br/>A forthcoming product due to be launched by Retirement Advantage later this year aims to do just that. The Retirement Account will combine an annuity element, offering moneyback on death or paying a guaranteed income for up to 30 years, with a drawdown account which pays out income or lump sums for occasional expenditures or emergencies - thereby allowing retirees to benefit from a highly flexible income. People using the account will be able to move between the two elements in a tax efficient way, while offering the ability to grow the value of investments. Customers will also<br/>be able to pass on funds to loved ones after death in a tax-efficient manner.<br/>“The difficulty with a traditional annuity is that when death occurs, money is suddenly paid out to the family - but it hasn’t been possible to plan when this happens, which may result in high tax costs,” Tully explains. “Using The Retirement Account, people will be able to take out a certain amount one year and then take out some more in future years, depending on their needs.”<br/>The Retirement Account has been designed to offer complete flexibility of income. Whilst a traditional annuity will pay out<br/>regular income come what may, the new product will allow people to retain income within the tax wrapper until needed, or it can be recycled into income drawdown.<br/>This is the first such product to be developed in the UK market, but with retirees increasingly focusing on flexibility it is likely that further innovation will follow. “This is where we are seeing the most interest -<br/>and this is where the industry is heading,” concludes Tully. “There’s a pent up demand for new solutions which will blend the benefits of both annuities and drawdowns in a tax efficient way, and which will adapt to people’s changing needs during retirement.”<br/>The value of investments may go down as well as up.Taking income in excess of the growth in the value of the Pension Funds may result inincomerunningoutquickerthanexpected.Taxationrulesand regulations may change in the future.

Those with substantial investments who can afford advice are on one side of the fault line, and stranded on the other, are those who cannot.<br/>The scramble to fill the advice gap includes the development of robo-advice. These<br/>are direct-to-consumer and adviser-less, in some cases offering much lower charges<br/>and intended to appeal to all, not just the stranded. The financial adviser however, has the advantage of human interaction. Do we believe that consumers will willingly entrust their retirement future to a machine that ring- fences them into a predefined model?<br/>The relationship between the financial adviser and client is built upon trust; trust<br/>in the adviser’s knowledge, experience and intuition. The financial advisers’ role is to research suitable investments for their clients and in order to do this, they utilise a range of tools at his/her disposal and must be able to interrogate any results from the tool, rather than outsource their work to it. Essential as they are, they are just that, tools. So ‘Star Ratings’ may be suitable for consumers, but not professionals. Software should not dictate the way in which an adviser works; instead, it should be flexible enough to fit around them, evolve with their processes and keep up with the ever growing compliance demands.<br/>What is Synaptic Comparator?<br/>Synaptic Comparator is an award-winning tool that allows the adviser to research on and off platform investment and retirement products.<br/>It will provide accurate analysis of total charges, Reduction in Yield (RIY) and net growth values. It is built to assess new business as well as switching existing investments. In order for a pension switch to be carried out,<br/>an adviser needs to consider the combined suitability, cost, existing investment, risk,<br/>and whole of market including stakeholder comparison for each individual client. All of this can be achieved by a savvy financial adviser operating Synaptic Comparator.<br/>Evidencing Suitability - Synaptic Comparator utilises the Synaptic system of feature filtering (which is currently celebrating its 21st year<br/>","27<br/>in the adviser tool box). The client’s specific investment scenario is captured, and specific requirements, by selecting individual features, the adviser can locate the most suitable vehicle for their investment.<br/>Cost - Synaptic Comparator looks at the combined cost of adviser fees, fund fees<br/>and platform/wrapper fees. The adviser’s fee profiles are maintained in the set-up area and can be tailored to each client. The system captures a firm’s assets under management, and any special terms as published to individual firms by the Provider.<br/>Existing Plan - The adviser can take account<br/>of the existing investment by entering the maturity values and growth rates from<br/>the Provider Illustration, allowing a true comparison of ceding scheme with rebroking options. A particular feature of the Synaptic tool is the ability to override growth rates for research purposes.<br/>The adviser can also utilise one of the four additional calculators on the outside of the tool:<br/>• The ‘Cost & Charges Calculator’ allows the adviser to factor in any additional costs that the client’s current illustration may be lacking, thereby obtaining a more accurate maturity value/RIY.<br/>• The ‘Maturity Value Calculator’ enables the adviser to combine two legacy investments for switching purposes.<br/>• In addition to these, the system also enables the provider to create their own projections with the ‘Projection Calculator’ and<br/>‘Critical Yield Calculator’. These calculators are separated from the main Synaptic Comparator journey, as they may not always be required for each individual client, thus streamlining the adviser’s process.<br/>Risk - The adviser can then locate the platform/wrapper that support the funds that they wish to recommend. By tackling the research in this manner, the adviser is able to employ his/her investment strategy. By entering the primary fund, Synaptic Comparator will select the supporting share class for each individual platform/wrapper in the results. The tool will also highlight the platform/wrappers that do not support the required funds.<br/>Software should not dictate the way in which an adviser works; instead, it should be flexible enough to fit around them, evolve with their processes and keep up with the ever growing compliance demands<br/>","28<br/>By employing intelligent software, the adviser can remain at the centre of the advice process, whilst still keeping up with technological advances, evolving compliance structures and growing demand<br/>To see how this approach can work within your business model, please contact us on 0800 783 4477<br/>or email sales@synaptic.co.uk.<br/>Results - suitability, cost, existing investment, risk, whole of market & stakeholder comparison<br/>The results produced give the adviser a full breakdown of net growth, final value, total charges and RIY for each suitable platform/ wrapper. The existing plan is clearly visible. The results also demonstrate an RU64 Stakeholder comparison. The impact of adviser fees can be highlighted by simply clicking the ‘Adviser fee’ toggle.<br/>‘Off Platform’ results are also presented in<br/>the same format as Platforms, with the top performing off platform product included in the main results as a direct comparison. At<br/>this stage, the adviser can select any suitable options available and provide a brief summary of their recommendation for the final report. ‘Comparison Reports’ document the client’s requirements and results of research journey in an accessible table, an essential appendix for any suitability report. The adviser can produce as many of these as he/she likes, with or without adviser charges, or even with different portfolio recommendations<br/>Conclusion<br/>The Synaptic Comparator process enables the adviser to rapidly produce bespoke compliant advice. Robo-generated solutions will continue to rise in popularity; however, this will never replace the relationship between the adviser and the client. By employing intelligent software, the adviser can remain at the centre of the advice process, whilst still keeping<br/>up with technological advances, evolving compliance structures and growing demand. Synaptic Comparator embodies the Synaptic ethos of allowing the adviser to deliver their investment strategy, rather than simply outsourcing it to a research tool.

It isn’t the full story, but it is interesting to see:<br/>Amount invested in Annuities<br/>Q1 2014 - £2.478bn Q1 2015 - £990m<br/>Drawdown on the other hand, showed an increase:<br/>Amount invested in Drawdown<br/>Q1 2014 - £573m Q1 2015 - £847m<br/>What we can’t see easily through the stats is: where has all the Annuity investment gone? Is it a whole series of small pots that has been withdrawn as cash? Are customers deferring their pensions?<br/>There is no one answer, there is no one consumer trend, every consumer is different and have different needs and this is why our professional advisers are so valuable - offering bespoke service to customers.<br/>With the benefit of hindsight, we all have 20/20 vision, and looking back to how the world was ‘pre freedoms’, for the majority of customers coming up to retirement, it was deemed as a financial planning finish line.<br/>I know the more well heeled customers had ongoing portfolios and in the main they are least affected by the freedoms, but for people with the smaller pots, they had to buy their compulsory purchase annuities and at least had a guaranteed pension for the rest of their lives.<br/>However that world slipped away, with the opening of a red portmanteau in Budget 2014 George wanted us all to have choice in coming up to retirement, and boy there is plenty of choice. It is not the easiest of choices to make, or perhaps for some it is? Self invested at retirement planning is the new mantra. So, in the old world, there was consternation in many camps, regarding customers staying with their host provider rather than shopping around and finding the best deal. What are the ABI stats showing us regarding this sort of behaviour?<br/>In Q1 2014 £971m stayed with the host provider, in Q1 2015 it was £600m. This figure is disproportionate to the huge reduction<br/>we have seen in volumes and does it speak volumes to the buying habits, or dare I say general malaise, of some of the current retirement population and the ongoing retirement conumdrum?<br/>Without doubt, for the majority of the UK, what pension freedoms have given us is a different approach to retirement. Dare I say it is no longer a financial planning finishing line, it is just the start of a fund decumulation journey with a series of gates or milestones; making the retirement pot work, having the flexibility to flex income, maximising taxation opportunities and to make decisions as life (and our health) changes around us.<br/>What does that mean for our industry? I think it falls into our hands, it is what great Financial Advisers have been doing for years, overlaying great business practices, understanding the customers risk appetite, understanding what they can afford to lose if things do not go according to plan, taking into account tax regimes and the position of the customers estate. All underpinned by the Advisers skill<br/>in analysing the options, the charges and performance, backed up by tools that support and not dictate.<br/>So to summarise, the retirement finishing line has gone, we will live forever that’s the good news, the slight downside is that we will need income of some sort forever and at the end of the day, as an old boss used to say to me at the beginning of each year... ‘you can’t get a quart in a pint pot, Bayliss’.

CFSL have requested asset allocation information from participating providers in a specific format aligned to the risk framework of the system. These asset classes are used by the model to determine the risk rating, a process that may result in a level of approximation though in most cases this will be insignificant. It is also possible that certain asset classes may not be represented exactly in the manner that providers would prefer.<br/>Reasonable endeavours are made to provide accuracy and consistency, however neither participating providers nor CFSL can be held responsible for any errors or omissions. No recommendation should be made solely on the basis of the Synaptic Risk Ratings, and additional research should be undertaken for any case.

Added to these, changes to the pensions regime make it a good time to launch a fund that aims to deliver a sustainable and growing yield - a fund that seeks to maintain and grow the real value of the capital invested across a diversified asset base in a way that creates better risk control than an equity or bond-only strategy.<br/>We launch products with our existing expertise in mind - new products are always a logical extension of the existing range. So, backed by an investment process with a proven track record (the 6-year-old Rathbone Strategic Growth Portfolio), on the 1st of October, we are launching the Rathbone Strategic Income Portfolio. It is a global multi-asset income fund offering sustainable income (paid monthly) and growth targets with a minimum nominal gross yield of 3% at current interest rate levels and<br/>a targeted total return of CPI +3% to 5% over a five to seven-year investment horizon. Some funds will opportunistically promise higher yields at the expense of disproportionate risk.<br/>Mindful of the danger of this, our fund will aim to have a targeted risk budget of two-thirds<br/>of the MSCI World index. The fund will be managed by David Coombs, Rathbones’ Head of Multi-Asset Investments who will use the same top-down investment process used for the existing multi-asset portfolios.<br/>Also, the fund is a perfect addition to our suite, given we are known specialists in both equity income and bond-investing, and the construction of multi-asset portfolios and strategies.<br/>Out key differentiator is our risk-targeting approach which seeks to generate an absolute return within a risk tolerance, rather than absolute income and/or return per se. This<br/>is favourable to chasing as high a yield as possible, which whilst optically attractive, might lead to a volatile income stream.<br/>Wide investment scope<br/>The fund will invest in an extensive range of vehicles and asset classes, including direct large-cap equity holdings (with high levels of dividend cover and low levels of debt but can grow earnings even in a slow growth environment), to meet these investment objectives. The inclusion of these equity holdings will also be extended across the entire multi-asset range which will give us<br/>a greater control of risk, and prove cheaper for investors. The fund’s global mandate and alternative income streams means it can act<br/>as a diversifier for, and complement to more traditional equity or equity income strategies - diversifiers may include short-term leasing and financing, REITs, structured products, structured credit and insurance, alongside mainstream equity and fixed income asset classes. We<br/>will have exposure to specialist funds in more illiquid areas which have low duration exposure, typically in closed ended funds.<br/>Sense and suitability<br/>The fund is suitable for income investors in<br/>a drawdown phase who want to retain or<br/>grow the real value of their capital alongside a sustainable income stream. We do not believe there is a single fund that can act as the panacea for all retirees as every individual will have specific circumstances. We do believe it<br/>is appropriate, however, as part of an overall retirement plan for many investors, as you<br/>the adviser deems suitable for your individual clients. It could be suitable for traditional global equity income investors who would consider the fund as a complement to their clients’ existing long-only holdings or those seeking<br/>an attractive building block in their retirement planning activities.<br/>A fixed-price launch period will open on the 16th September and close on the 1st October, when the fund will begin trading.

Besides this so- called credit risk, investors must also consider interest rate risk.<br/>The Synaptic Guide to Bonds<br/>The Pros and Cons of Investing in Bonds<br/>In theory, bonds should appeal to risk-averse investors.<br/>A bond is simply a loan, so the buyer effectively lends money to the issuer. In return the borrower pays interest, known as the coupon, which is usually paid in pre-set amounts at pre-set times.<br/>When the original loan matures the borrower will repay the initial investment, or loan, which is known as the principal.<br/>You therefore know what yield you will receive over the life of the bond and that you should<br/>get your money back at the end. This is not the case with shares traded on the stock market. And if the bond issuer does go bust, bondholders will probably get back a number of pence in the pound, relative to their initial investment, in contrast to shareholders, who are bottom of the pile of creditors and usually lose everything.<br/>The danger, no matter how small, of the debt issuer going broke makes it clear bonds are<br/>not risk-free. Besides this so-called credit risk, investors must also consider interest rate<br/>risk. If interest rates rise, any newly-issued<br/>debt comes with a higher coupon to tempt investors to buy it rather than simply put<br/>their funds in cash and take the interest. This generally causes bond prices to fall as holders sell existing positions to buy the new debt with the higher coupon. Investors must also be wary of liquidity risk and make sure a bond’s issue size means it can be easily bought and sold.<br/>Buying a bond at issue and simply holding it to maturity will provide protection against interest rate and liquidity risk, but bondholders must also keep an eye on inflation. If that gallops higher, the bond’s coupons become worth less in real, inflation-adjusted terms, though you can buy inflation-linked bonds to tackle this threat.<br/>Experienced bond investors tend to build a portfolio of holdings across different issuers and maturities. Less confident ones may prefer to buy a bond fund and pay a fund manager to do the work for them, although in this case the fees will eat into the income generated by the coupons.<br/>Russ Mould<br/>Investment Director, AJ Bell<br/>","Death Doesn’t Have to be Taxing<br/>The certainties of ‘death and taxes’ are as applicable today as they were in the 18th century.<br/>What Daniel Defoe, or more famously Benjamin Franklin, couldn’t have anticipated was the increasingly complex UK tax system; evident in the Conservative’s Summer Budget. What are the positives? From 2017/18 there will be a separate additional main residence nil rate band (MRNRB). This will provide a further £100k allowance in respect of a property that is/has been a person’s main UK residence on/or after 08/07/15.<br/>This allowance is set to increase by £25k each tax year, reaching £175k by 2020/21 when it will then rise in line with the consumer price index. This will be transferable to spouses or civil partners where the surviving spouse/civil partner dies after 6 April 2017. This gives us the Conservative’s headline nil rate band of £1m: (£325k + £175k) X 2.<br/>As ever the devil of this so called ‘IHT giveaway’ is in the detail:<br/>• the standard nil rate band is frozen at £325,000 until 2020/21.<br/>• the MRNRB will be phased from 2017/18 - these changes will not benefit estates until this time.<br/>• from 2017/18, anyone who has been UK resident for more than 15 of the last 20 years will be deemed domiciled for ALL taxes;<br/>• Furthermore, HMRC will monitor the use of overseas excluded property trusts that hold UK residential property. From 2017/18 these trusts will be ‘looked through’ for inheritance tax (IHT) purposes - bringing such properties back into the UK IHT net.<br/>• once an estate exceeds £2m the MRNRB tapers away - the very wealthy will not benefit from the MRNRB.<br/>The requirement for IHT planning may now seem outdated, but this isn’t quite true. The £1m nil rate band will not apply until 2020/21 and will only apply if a person:<br/>A) has a spouse/civil partner;<br/>B) and owns a UK property worth more than £350k that they’ve lived in as their main residence on/after 8 July 2015;<br/>C) and their estate is worth less than £2.7m.<br/>For most, the various changes mean that this is actually an IHT freeze and not the ‘giveaway’ suggested.

Now<br/>investors are<br/>increasingly looking<br/>to fixed income for<br/>something more.<br/>We understand that many investors are looking to benefit from both rising and falling markets. At Legal and General Investment Management, we designed our Dynamic Bond Trust to be flexible - investing across the full fixed income spectrum and accessing potential sources<br/>of return that are beyond the reach of more conventional funds. It aims to enhance returns by allocating predominantly to higher income credit across a range of asset classes and geographies in order to help clients meet their<br/>yield objectives, whilst managing downside risk. This is complemented by additional sources<br/>of alpha generation, including global relative value opportunities across credit, rates and FX markets.<br/>This flexible ‘go anywhere’ approach means that every position in the portfolio is taken due to a positive absolute view, rather than one based on a view relative to a benchmark. Furthermore this flexible approach provides access to a broader, liquid universe of issues/ issuers, improving diversification and allowing us to invest where there is the most value either on a market or issuer/issue basis, whilst unwanted currency and interest rate exposures are hedged.<br/>Client requirements and return expectations from fixed income are changing in this low interest rate and credit spread environment. There is a clear move away from benchmark oriented credit and separating out duration, investment grade and high yield credit exposures in order to optimise risk /return from the broader fixed income opportunity set. We think this sort of flexible bond strategy will form an increasing part of fixed income investment demand - particularly as monetary<br/>policy normalises and interest rates start to rise, potentially creating a headwind for traditional fixed income strategies.<br/>Omar Saeed<br/>Senior Macro Credit Fund Manager, Legal & General Investment Management<br/>","Investment Bonds - Still a Useful Tax Planning Option Post RDR<br/>There is a school of<br/>thought that believes<br/>investment bonds<br/>should be consigned<br/>to the repository for<br/>old style commission<br/>loaded products that<br/>have no place in the<br/>adviser charged world.<br/>But this, of course, overlooks the fact that an investment bond, (whether a non-qualifying single premium whole of life or capital redemption policy) does offer some significant planning opportunities which still apply.<br/>Whilst the investment bond does not actually provide tax free income, it is possible to withdraw up to 5% of the amount invested per policy year for up to 20 years before tax may be payable thus deferring the tax liability on any growth<br/>to when the policyholder may be paying income tax at a lower rate. The allowance is cumulative so that it can be carried forward from any year in which it is not used.<br/>The policyholder will not be liable for any capital gains tax on assets disposed of within the bond - gains may be subject to income tax only when there is a chargeable event such as on surrender, exceeding the tax deferred allowance or on death of the last life assured.<br/>By assigning some or all of the identical segments within the bond it also possible<br/>to move the tax point, for example to a non or basic rate taxpaying student who could surrender the segments to provide university fees. This is particularly advantageous for trustees of a discretionary trust where up<br/>to 45% income tax could be payable if<br/>the segments were surrendered within the trust and the proceeds paid out rather than assigning them to the beneficiary.<br/>Where an investment bond is the sole property held within a trust then there is no requirement to complete a trust tax return until such time as there is a chargeable event. Trust administration costs can be lower than where investments are held directly with income and capital gains having to be reported in the tax year they arise.<br/>So the investment bond still provides a useful tax planning option which should<br/>not be overlooked despite its history of being used as a “fire and forget” commission hungry product.<br/>Brian Radbone<br/>Head of Technical Services Transact<br/>Where an investment bond is the sole property held within a trust then there is no requirement<br/>to complete a trust tax return until such time as there is a chargeable event<br/>39<br/>The Synaptic Guide to Bonds<br/>","40<br/>We Are Client Care: What We’d Like to doForYou<br/>Gabby Attewell | Linda Waring | Marie Aylward | Warren O’Connell | Synaptic Client Care Team<br/>Our work begins once you decide to sign<br/>on the metaphorical dotted line!<br/>Up until that time you will have spoken to your Synaptic Account Manager, maybe had demonstrations or a trial and certainly had the software explained and summarised to you in salestalk.Youwillhavekickeditaround,mulled it over and probably compared notes with our competitors’ offerings before taking that leap of faith that the Synaptic range is the one for you.

I have the newspaper cutting in front of me from 25 years ago when the firm celebrated its 25th anniversary which talked about the transition of management from founder (Sid) to second generation (Bob and Diane). Fast forward another twenty five years and Whichers are celebrating their 50th year in business. Bob and Diane are currently at the height of their powers, applying themselves to implement the latest round of changes brought about by the pension’s reforms.<br/>So much about Whichers will strike chords with other of our customers. Certainly the tireless ability to adapt to changes in the industry and the economy, with willingness to embrace new ideas and implement<br/>them using the latest technology. When Sid Whicher started the business, the focus was initially on Mortgages and then embraced General Insurance when another of Sid’s sons,<br/>Bryan, joined the business. Sid used to set up endowment style investments to run alongside the mortgages. Diane moved from a City<br/>job in the early eighties, bringing investment expertise with her, enabling the firm to widen their proposition.<br/>Fortune smiled in a big way on Whichers and their clients in the crash of the late eighties. It was a time when the Life Co’s were building their retail investment business through independent advisers, offering incentives<br/>for rebroking their investment bonds. Diane was in such a process - meaning that their clients were briefly out of the market when it tumbled. This provided an excellent platform for success for those fortunate investors and Whichers has offered clients a full investment service ever since.<br/>Whicher’s links to Synaptic Software go back to the early days of back office development. A commitment to early adoption of software and computer based solutions led to some significant challenges. The first automated processes in the business were with Misys, after which the business decided to move<br/>to Quay Software back office (Client Care Desktop or CCD), adopting one of the best-selling back office systems with over 10,000 users (in the early noughties). Diane remembers the migration of data by a third party from Misys to CCD as being a<br/>difficult experience. It is a tribute to Diane’s tenacity that the process was completed to a high standard. Whichers became a working partner with Quay Software, continuing the collaboration with Synaptic Software.<br/>Whicher’s have also been at the forefront<br/>of the scanning revolution ‘the biggest breakthrough’, recognising the advantages<br/>of working towards a ‘paperless’ office. Whenever a file came out, it was scanned and stored digitally. Working in this way was also tough in the early days, but it set the<br/>bar for the efficiency gains that automation offered. Bob had by now taken over the technical development of the business, a role he retains to this day, keeping abreast of all innovation. Bob was an early adopter of the fund supermarkets and then wraps, and today values a close relationship with Standard<br/>Life, whose service and tools make efficient administration achievable. Modern wraps also allow access to wide range of investments,<br/>and Whichers namecheck Russell Investments, OBSR, Rowan Dartington amongst others for portfolio management. Whichers perform a thorough annual due diligence review of all aspects of their proposition to ensure that they are working with the best, keeping an open mind at all times.<br/>","43<br/>They are currently at the height of their powers,<br/>applying themselves to implement the latest round of changes brought about by the pension’s reforms<br/>CCD continues to be an important and integral part of the business, particularly in regards<br/>to reconciling payments from providers and customers, and preparing management reports. The firm has always used data to analyse the profitability of clients and ensure that effort is applied to those areas where maximum value can be derived for clients, and saying no to clients who do not fit the relevant profile.<br/>Whichers are in an interesting place as they have a loyal customer base of over 300 active clients, built solely through referrals. Diane says her single biggest problem is encouraging clients to spend more of their savings, as they tend to be prudent individuals of retirement age.Whichers endeavour to have their records up to date, so reviews tend to be more about catching up about life in general. Because Bob and Diane know their clients so well, they feel a heightened duty of care for them.<br/>The effort to stay ahead of regulation and compliance is a constant and difficult battle given the constant tinkering that goes on.<br/>Client packs are now thick parcels; ironic given that clients employ advisers like Whichers<br/>to ‘take care of the detail’ so they don’t<br/>have to, operating to a large extent on trust. Whichers resent having to swallow (along with others) the bitter bill of paying indirectly for the compensation that is constantly<br/>being offered to ‘victims’ of poor schemes that unscrupulous advisers are incentivised<br/>to sell, usually disappearing and leaving the good firms to pick up the bill. In addition, the pressure of regulation makes it difficult for businesses like theirs to plan for the future, as their community based philosophy for building for the future seems to be old fashioned where many of the younger generation are being encouraged to access the good things<br/>in life without having built a secure financial foundation. Bob agrees that the majority of the next generation of clients will be managed online.<br/>Bob and Diane are ferociously dedicated to looking after their clients. ‘The client comes first’. Whether their approach will last to the next generation remains to be seen, and that will depend on whether the regulator and the industry learn to value independents like Whichers who still manage to do everything correctly by the book and by their clients.<br/>Contact us:<br/>Whichers IFAs Ltd 150-152 Brighton Rd Coulsdon<br/>Surrey<br/>CR5 2YQ<br/>Tel: 020 8763 8090<br/>E-mail info@whichers.com Web www.whichersifa.com<br/>The effort to stay ahead of regulation and compliance is a constant and difficult battle given the constant tinkering that goes on<br/>","44<br/>HowdoYouSet Client Fees?<br/>Alison Street | Key Account Manager | Synaptic Software Limited<br/>Alison Street, Key<br/>Account Manager,<br/>Synaptic Software<br/>Limited looks at<br/>CCD’s time keeping and<br/>reporting capabilities.<br/>The RDR review had the objective of fundamentally changing the way that IFA’s receive remuneration, moving away from the commission model to Adviser fees.<br/>In a discussion paper titled Smarter Consumer Communications, the regulator has urged all financial services firms to communicate more clearly with clients, especially on fees and charges.<br/>This has increased the need for back office systems to support not only the ability to raise client fees but to provide sufficient Management Information to give substance and meaning to the fees charged, primarily through the recording of time taken for each step in the advice and review process.<br/>Synaptic Client Care Desktop (CCD) gives a detailed insight into how and where a practice is generating remuneration at Client, Company, Type of Activity and Individual level.<br/>Client Level<br/>The client account in CCD gives you a quick visual summary of each individual clients profitability.<br/>Time recorded at work and task level can be charged at the correct rate for each individual<br/>staff member, each member of staff can have 2 charging rates one for admin and one for advice, especially useful for smaller firms where advisers might complete admin tasks as well as giving advice.

Very quickly, they’ll start<br/>talking about what’s most important to them to protect, and why. It’s a really<br/>easy way for you to tee up the need for financial protection, and the importance<br/>of income protection with your clients.<br/>So far it’s helped to power over 30,000 client conversations and advisers tell us it’s helped them to demonstrate the value of their financial advice and is integral to their recommendation process.<br/>One regular user said,<br/>“The LV= risk reality calculator is a great tool which I use to help introduce protection needs to my clients.

In particular, the Seven Families campaign is highlighting the importance of having help and guidance as well as money if you can’t work.<br/>and you’ll often discover another myth: ‘my employer will always look after me’. And only two million workers are covered by group IP - it’s not compulsory and the market is ripe for growth.<br/>5. The State will provide.<br/>The State increasingly expects people to<br/>look after themselves. In July the Chancellor announced Support for Mortgage Interest (SMI) will soon become a loan rather than a right. The logic is that taxpayers shouldn’t be expected to subsidise homebuyers’ mortgages. It’s merely the latest in a series of moves designed to cut the State’s welfare bill.<br/>6. IP is too expensive.<br/>Based on ABI data, the average IP policy sold in 2014 costs about £1 a day. Is that too much to protect you and your family?<br/>7. IP is just like PPI - but sold by IFAs rather than lenders.<br/>PPI can be a good product - if sold correctly and if it meets the customer’s needs - but long term IP can’t be cancelled by the insurer, can provide a benefit every month up to retirement age, not just for a few months, and premiums (which may be guaranteed or rising) are not subject to IPT.<br/>So here are 12 myths related to income protection. I’ve heard all of them as reasons why IP sales are lower than they should be. And all of them are wrong. But, myths are powerful things (I still believe in Father Christmas...) so let’s separate the truth from the myth.<br/>1. Clients don’t want or need IP.<br/>Countless research studies now show this just isn’t true. When the different types of cover are explained (that’s where you come in!),<br/>IP invariably ranks as one of if not the most important type of cover. Quite simply, without continuing income, most people’s financial aims and plans won’t be met.<br/>2. Premiums go up every year.<br/>With some IP policies premiums are designed to rise annually, with the increases usually set at outset (this means lower premiums initially, so there are advantages as well as<br/>disadvantages). But most IP premiums are guaranteed and only rise if cover increases.<br/>3. Most IP claims are not paid.<br/>On average the public thinks only 38% of claims are paid. But latest ABI claims data shows 92.9% of all individual IP claims were paid in 2014 and GRiD stats show 83% of group IP claims were paid in 2014. Why not 100%? IP claims are not paid if there is no fall in income, non-disclosure, if the customer could work but isn’t, or if there was fraud.<br/>4. People know what sick pay<br/>they are entitled to because their employer tells them and employers have to have IP cover anyway.<br/>If only! ABI and others such as the Income Protection Task Force are campaigning<br/>for annual sick pay statements but most employers are not yet doing it. See the details<br/>","49<br/>ABI knows that IP’s potential is growing and that people need help to understand where their protection gaps are and how easily and affordably they can be met<br/>8. IP’s too complicated. It’s not for me.<br/>Too complicated compared to pensions or investments? Really? Yes, there can be traps for the unwary and quirks you’ll quickly learn, but familiarity breeds knowledge and confidence. The key is good training, then keeping IP front of mind to ensure your knowledge remains up-to-date.<br/>9. IP benefits are taxed.<br/>Group IP benefits are paid to the employer who then pays the employee’s salary, which is taxable and subject to NICs, as with any salary payment. But individual IP benefits are tax free.<br/>10.With IP you get underwritten at outset and again when you claim.<br/>Income checks when a claim is made can happen (to ensure there’s still a financial incentive to return to work) but many insurers now offer a guaranteed benefit level too.<br/>11. You don’t need IP if you have critical illness insurance.<br/>The two most common IP claims heads - musculoskeletal and mental health - simply aren’t covered by CI. Fact is, most people would benefit from both types of cover - they are complementary, not competing.<br/>12. Insurers can change the terms and the price of IP if they want to - annually or at very little notice.<br/>ASU insurers can but long term IP insurers can’t (IP used to be called permanent health insurance because the benefits were ‘permanent’).<br/>Some of these myths come not from clients but from advisers. Fact is, it’s easy to be sucked in by some of them, simply because we’ve heard them so often they must be true!<br/>Let’s conclude with four reasons why now<br/>is a good time to brush up on IP knowledge and perhaps to run a campaign to talk to businesses and individuals to see if IP is right for them, right now.<br/>1. The ABI is getting behind IP. At this year’s Protection Review Conference in July, ABI policy adviser Charlie Campbell (himself the son of an IFA) was quoted by Cover magazine as saying: “Something we’re working on at the moment is a prototype workplace statement which will try to create a bit of a journey and bring a bit of awareness to employees about what they are entitled to as an individual from their employer. And it will create a clear link<br/>to a household benefits calculator situated<br/>somewhere like the Money Advice Service so they can see personally what they need to do to move with sick pay and once that’s comes to an end what they as a household will be entitled to from the state.” ABI knows that IP’s potential is growing and that people need help to understand where their protection gaps are and how easily and affordably they can be met.<br/>2. Seven Families is highlighting the value of IP and how it’s more than just a cheque every month. Look at it as a dynamic and engaging sales aid. You and your clients can follow developments at www.7families.co.uk.<br/>3. IPT rising from 6% to 9.5% from November 2015 will make all annually and monthly renewable general insurance policies (including PPI, MPPI and ASU) more expensive. That may make switching to IP more attractive (subject to all the usual caveats about having to be clearly in the customer’s best interests).<br/>4. If you don’t someone else will...<br/>","50<br/>The Synaptic Webline Difference: A True Portal<br/>John Willis | Director | Synaptic Software Limited<br/>John Willis recalls<br/>the development of Synaptic Webline since the beginning of the internet story.<br/>It’s sometimes hard to remember that a couple of decades ago premium rates for life products were pretty static. Those advisers who had invested in PCs would receive a pile of diskettes every few weeks from each provider, have to load them on their machine, and could then obtain a detailed quote. Or they could just phone the provider’s support desk instead! But even this “major” technological development only provided a single provider’s outlook<br/>- if the adviser needed a proper premium comparison they’d have to run multiple such quotes on their PC, or - more usually - phone multiple provider call centres! The alternative was to provide quotes on a strictly limited panel, of course.<br/>Over time, the industry regulator has rightly made it clear that “customers must be treated fairly” - in this respect, a price comparison of multiple products from a wide panel of insurers would seem to be the logical requirement.<br/>Over the last 15 years or so, advisers have had the ability to subscribe to a number of<br/>specialised online quote facilities (portals), aimed at delivering comprehensive quote<br/>and apply services to them. But the whole landscape has been changing, with more consumers turning to online, self-service facilities, which enables them to shop around for the best deals. Today there are many online quotes services on the Internet for consumers - the likes of MoneySuperMarket.com, Cavendish Online and comparethemarket.com - but even they<br/>rely on the same portal services “behind the scenes” in order to get the premium prices in the first place.<br/>Portal essentials<br/>When Synaptic Webline was first launched<br/>in 2000, one its key aims was to deliver a comparative quotation service that brokers<br/>who were using computers for the first time could navigate - it had to be easy to use, and require the minimum amount of maintenance or update by the users themselves. It had to be affordable - while other quote services existed they used special equipment, making the cost of using them high, so Synaptic Webline designed its services to use the Internet, with standard PC hardware and software as far as possible.<br/>","51<br/>Services had to cater for the regulated (IFA) market as well as the non-regulated advisers- perhaps a mortgage adviser selling protection insurance as well. It needed to work for a single High Street firm as well as for a national network with (potentially) hundreds of users in many offices around the country. And, as the Internet itself evolved and became more “acceptable”, it had to cater for the desires<br/>of larger online organisations who - having spent a large amount on advertising - needed a service that could cater for sudden, large increases in traffic volumes. The ability for organisations to manage multiple access has always been part of the Webline proposition.<br/>Trying to provide a true comparison quotation service has always been a bit of a conundrum for the portals - on the one hand the users need to know that they are comparing “apples with apples”, but on the other hand, providers themselves are (unsurprisingly) constantly tweaking their products to present new<br/>and different options and benefits for the consumer. So finding the right set of product options for users to select is key to a successful service.<br/>At the same time, technology has moved on apace - old “Internet dial up” systems have been replaced with early versions of so-called “broadband” and now “fibre” offers even faster speeds for data connections. PC prices have tumbled over the years while the machines got more powerful and faster at the same time - and now tablets and smart-phones<br/>are accepted as a necessity by many. All of this meant that portal services have evolved and grown at the same time, so - for example - a Synaptic Webline user can obtain their comparison result tables in just a few seconds, showing the results of perhaps 40 or 50 products side by side.<br/>The Synaptic Webline journey takes the user seamlessly from ‘quote’ to ‘illustration’ through to ‘e-apply’.This is essentially the Protection presale process, and Synaptic Webline’s role is to make<br/>it as accessible as possible. The system has the ability to pre-populate data in many instances, including information from the back office.<br/>This needs a solution / infrastructure that’s highly scalable - able to support from 50 quotes per day to 1,000’s quotes per hour; 24 x 7; from simple web page to web services;<br/>providing low cost option equally to High Street IFA to National to high-volume online web sites. This flexibility is the hallmark of the Synaptic Webline approach - enabling<br/>a tailored service to be delivered online inexpensively.<br/>Cover Me Now is Synaptic’s current initiative, designed to handle impaired life quotes whilst avoiding the need to interact with multiple providers. Providers have agreed in advance<br/>the profiles of customers who can be offered cover and put on risk immediately - so “simple underwriting” and “Buy now” can be delivered. This is truly revolutionary, and departs from the efforts being made elsewhere to concentrate on the order of the sales process, rather than eliminate the blockages, including the need to travel through the Provider’s systems to get<br/>on cover.<br/>The two screenshots show how Synaptic Webline has developed to serve its two main customer groups, ‘web service’ brands and adviser firms.<br/>Contact us:<br/>We invite you to consider how Synaptic Webline could help develop your Protection sales capabilities.

This has led to product developments based on a tick-box mentality rather than by analysis of what would really benefit the customer. As a consequence the market hasn’t grown and this leaves customers exposed and with an increasingly complex product to deal with.<br/>We’d like to see a greater focus on customer needs, with simpler definitions and cover where it actually counts. Having a critical illness usually forces a change in lifestyle. But a critical illness payout should help a customer to carry on living their life - in their home, with their family, with the best treatment available. And the added-value services provided by some insurers then provide practical and emotional support at a time when they’ll need that too.<br/>What’s the problem?<br/>The biggest problem is the definitions used to determine when a claim will be paid. The definition of each illness is so full of impenetrable medical terminology that it’s no wonder people struggle to understand what it is they have and when they can claim.<br/>We all know that people don’t read the detail of the definition. They hear from their adviser and see the headline in product literature that this policy covers cancer, heart attack, stroke, and so on. So they believe they’ll be covered if they’re diagnosed with one of these conditions. It’s inevitable, then, that they’ll be disappointed when their insurance company tells them it was the wrong type of cancer or the heart attack wasn’t severe enough or the stroke was in the wrong place.<br/>This leads to mistrust, compounded by the fact that most people only hear about the claims that are turned down. As an industry we’re not good at telling people about the good things we do for them. It’s hard to draw a positive story from a critical illness experience, but we can talk about better outcomes for our customers by providing invaluable support services as well as quality cover.<br/>Providers also worry they won’t be recommended unless they cover the longest list of illnesses. And advisers have started<br/>to worry about being sued by clients who get an illness covered under a policy other than the one recommended. This is despite the well-known fact that about 90% of all claims come from just 4 or 5 definitions. And that many of the other (long list of) definitions have never, and probably will never, lead to claims being paid.<br/>","53<br/>88%<br/>47<br/>AT<br/>5%<br/>REJECTED FOR NOT MEETING THE DEFINITION<br/>1%<br/>REJECTED FOR MISREPRESENTATION<br/>C M Y CM MY CY CMY K<br/>53% 47%<br/>TOP 5 REASONS FOR CLAIM<br/>62%<br/>CHILDREN’S CI 5% MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS 3%<br/>£84k AVERAGE PAYOUT<br/>£367k<br/>AVERAGE PAID EACH DAY<br/>£900k HIGHEST PAYOUT<br/>£134m TOTAL PAID<br/>Source: Bright Grey and Scottish Provident claims paid (1 January to 31 December 2014).

What do they value for their clients? Is it having a full and exhaustive<br/>list of illnesses covered? Is it the quality<br/>or simplicity of the definitions for the top reasons for claim? Is it added-value services? In truth it’s probably a mixture of all of these that influences how and why individual advisers make recommendations for each client. But we think providers should adapt their thinking and try to create tailored propositions, with simpler definitions, that encourage advisers and customers to trust<br/>in what we’re in business to do. Which is to pay claims. This may be a tiered benefits approach or a customer choice.<br/>But regardless of how the market moves, the winners will be the successful claimants who trust their insurer and recognise the difference their payout has made to their lives.<br/>We believe in growing the market by offering tools for advisers to help educate clients.

Analysis of the ABI market statistics reveals a significant decline in overall sales of Protection. The number of new contracts<br/>is on a downward trend. This is a source<br/>of great consternation to all of us who believe that the growing Protection Gap<br/>is a major concern, and are working hard towards the common goal of reversing the grinding decline - clinging onto our belief that Protection must form the foundation to financial security and any financial plan.<br/>Further examination reveals that the traditional route for protection sales by the nation’s intermediaries is actually faring worse than the figures might suggest, as they are being masked by the stratospheric increase in online originated sales.<br/>Have a look at the Synaptic Webline non- advised protection applications over the<br/>30% decrease<br/>2008: £215m<br/>2014: £165m<br/>£50m<br/>Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4<br/>2008 2009<br/>2010<br/>2011 2012<br/>2013 2014 Source: ABI<br/>same period of the graph above.

These statistics prove this to be NOT true. Consumers are simply<br/>Total in new premiums £m<br/>","COVER ME NOW<br/>55<br/>choosing online routes that offer them greater control. For many reasons, unless they are specialists such as Lifesearch, Reassured or Mortgage Advice Bureau, intermediaries are falling off the protection sales bandwagon, and passing the baton over to their online counterparts as they lay exhausted in a bureaucratic and regulation induced haze.<br/>As this new technologically shaped landscape emerges, you would expect to observe the effort and ingenuity of the industry to be applied to reduce the friction for consumers at the known pinch points, growing the protection pie at source. What we actually observe is that some important players in our industry are embracing a solution that was conceived in a different time, and does not focus on the dynamics of the online journeys, rather seeks to move the order of the steps in the sales process by bringing the underwriting ‘up front’.<br/>This of course does not seek to influence the online journey, rather it risks perpetuating the chronic weakness of the old approach by seeking to provide individual underwriting to multiple participating providers - requiring enough information to be acquired upfront to satisfy multiple Providers’ rules before any Guaranteed Quotes can be formulated.<br/>Presentation of a range of results then needs to be made to include those Providers<br/>who do not subscribe to the upfront underwriting. It is a solution borne out of the industry’s perspective on sales rather than the consumers’ experience. Several years ago, Mike Ward of Payingtoomuch.com suggested at the Protection Review forum that it was the role of the portals rather than the underwriters to deliver a streamlined online journey, and we think he was right. We would go further and suggest it is ‘Synaptic Webline’ who should assume the mantle, given its pre-eminence in supporting the new breed of protection sellers.<br/>From inception, Synaptic Webline focused on developing a technological layer that could be ‘consumed’ in a flexible way by online brands who could design their own journeys. This is proving to be a prescient strategy as it is an efficient and easy way to work, and manages the technical interface between on-line brands or intermediaries with multiple brokers and providers. We<br/>are estimating that Synaptic Webline is<br/>now facilitating over 20% of the UK’s term business. So rather than focus on rearranging the deckchairs on the old ship, in typical pioneering fashion, Synaptic Webline is working with the reinsurance industry, the providers and the distributors to agree a short, common list of questions that can be used to generate a Guaranteed quote for the majority of online applicants. This offers the opportunity for prospects to seal a deal and go on risk in a single pass.<br/>This also offers advisers a simple tool to close the gap with the online intermediaries, knowing that in most cases they too<br/>will be able to put a customer on risk<br/>with one short session. Cover Me Now<br/>will produce a single table with rates on demand, including rates that are actionable immediately. Providers and intermediaries will be generating business more smoothly and in greater volume - because rather<br/>than tweaking the old process and hoping for a better result, Synaptic Webline will have removed friction in the online journey, assisting the known reservoir of demand<br/>to be converted more efficiently towards completion.<br/>After all, as the online experts will tell you, what people want in the digital age is a ‘true’ price that they can access online when they want to, not forms, conversations with underwriters or disjointed processes that do not provide a rounded picture.<br/>Synaptic Webline is offering a new opportunity for participants to help grow the whole pot rather than fine tune aspects of the old approach, and in doing so, achieve the impact in sales that the industry desperately needs.<br/>Contact us:<br/>Any interested parties should contact:<br/>Adam Byford, Managing Director of Synaptic Software Limited adam.byford@synaptic.co.uk<br/>COVER ME NOW<br/>","Enjoy an easy life with Webline<br/>Buying financial products online has never been easier with the help of the Synaptic Webline portal, which can be accessed for<br/>Not only can you compare hundreds of online products against each other, you can also apply online directly into the chosen providers extranet, reducing time and effort usually spent re-keying data.<br/>By applying directly from Synaptic Webline firms may be entitled to an extra 10% of additional commission –<br/>For more information call us on<br/>0800 783 4477 or visit us at www.synaptic.co.uk<br/>Applying Online - The Myths and Facts<br/>• The cost for applying via Webline is exactly the same as<br/>trading with the Provider on their site.<br/>• Webline portal will take a cut of the plan commission due to the adviser.<br/>• Applying via Webline means the data from the quote is populated, avoiding double data entry.<br/>• Application process cannot be re-started from within Webline service.<br/>• The Providers treat the application in exactly the same way as an application coming in via their extranet.<br/>• Advisers are often entitled up to an additional 10%<br/>commission when applying from Webline into provider extranet.<br/>• The client data is not kept by Webline, the application is input directly onto the provider’s system.<br/>• There is no cost to you or the client for sending the application in via Webline.<br/>Free to existing customers<br/>this could result in huge gains<br/>you could even earn more commission<br/>Fact Myth<br/>Fact<br/>Fact Myth<br/>Fact Fact<br/>Fact<br/>"];
