Since we talked last a bunch of stuff has been going on in platform and fintech- land.We’ve seen court intrigue around various providers being up for sale, or not. We’ve found a new buzz-phrase in robo-advice (more of<br/>this in a moment). And we’ve watched with interest the GLORIOUS NEW PENSIONS DAWN (GLONPEND) change behaviour radically.<br/>During all this, the platform sector has been plugging away, doing what it does and – in all too many cases – regarding its navel. When I look at platforms in 2015, compared to when I set the lang cat up five years ago, I must be honest and say that many of them seem not to have evolved all that much.<br/>direct side have got everyone talking. Robo- advice (and we should just get used to that term, industry suggestions like ‘remote digital advice’ or ‘algorithmic advice’ are exactly as likely to change the new convention as me telling my daughter to stop using the word ‘like’ as punctuation) is a case in point.<br/>Have you had a look at the robos? Most<br/>of them do very little. You put in some information about your existing savings and how much you can put away; you set a goal, and then answer some questions on risk tolerance. From that an asset allocation and a wrappersplitiskickedout.Youacceptit,and then the system tells you whether you’re on track or not. That’s it. We’ve spent time both in the UK and the USA looking at these systems, and our finding is that there are no robots, and they are not giving advice. And this Star Wars- raised kid is pretty pissed off about that. While we’re at it, I’m still waiting for my jetpack.<br/>Nonetheless, what is undeniable is that the advent of ‘robo’ has brought the idea of goals-based planning out of the niche financial planning sector and into the mainstream. Is it new? No. True Potential, for example, has been doing it for a while. But we see here a glimmer of where platforms could evolve to.<br/>This sense of platforms needing to go somewhere; needing to evolve into something<br/>Yes, we’ve had regulatory change to deal with. Yes, we’re dealing with GLONPEND. But this sector, which had the ability to rip up the rulebook and start again; this sector which had the ability to put the client at the centre and abstract all the horrible icky stuff away from adviser firms, is stuck in the mud.<br/>Put it this way. If financial planning is now<br/>the product, why do so few platforms allow advisers to record goals, map portfolios to them and then record progress? Why does that have to be done elsewhere? Many platforms<br/>don’t let you hold two different model portfolios against the same client. Most have horrible, and I do mean horrible, ugly, lumpen reporting; many advisers tell us they would rather fill out their GABRIEL returns than put these in front of clients. Usability also remains awful for many. Promises were made about how good these things would be to use. In many cases – not all – those promises have not been kept.<br/>Meanwhile, some frankly very ordinary and a few less ordinary developments over on the<br/>","5<br/>Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus<br/>If financial planning is now the product, why do so few<br/>error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque<br/>platforms allow advisers to record goals, map portfolios<br/>to them and then record progress? Why does that have<br/>laudantium<br/>to be done elsewhere?<br/>else, something better, is what’s behind our claim that platforms (as we know them at least) are dead. Yes, it’s clickbait. But there’s some truth in there too.<br/>Before we all pack up and go home it’s<br/>worth considering exactly what constitutes a platform these days. The common consensus seems to be there are around 30 platforms, which then leads onto the inevitable question of how sustainable this is and when the market<br/>trying to diversify and secure more through integration of asset management, DFM, D2C, offshore platforms, protection or advice. Everyone has a platform as part of their proposition, but just being a platform is not enough for all but a handful of companies.<br/>So, what of the future? We believe the migration and amalgamation costs for any merger or acquisition are so significant only the brave and well-funded will go down<br/>large multiple of the acquisition price, all in all making any such acquisition both financially and politically very unpalatable.<br/>Platforms therefore need to take a close look at the market, listen to what advisers actually want from platforms, and reinvent themselves. Gone are the days of needing loads of funds. Advisers want either genuine open architecture, or access to outsourced solutions such as model portfolios and DFMs. The bells and whistles of funky tools are no longer relevant.<br/>Integration to external tools and systems such as FE Analytics, Finametrica, IRESS & Intelliflo are increasingly important and should work much more effectively than they currently do. The challenging times that some platforms are facing represents a good opportunity to focus on doing the basics well. A platform that is well integrated with external tools, offers a range of outsourced investment solutions, and delivers reliable custody with great service will find that the future is bright. We fear for the rest.<br/>If you want to read more about all this stuff, may we please shill a little bit for our new guide to the advised platform market? It too is called ‘Platforms Are Dead’ and is available from the lang cat website for an almost embarrassingly small consideration.

And they were probably right.... but if the events of the last 12 months have highlighted why advisers should place profitability front<br/>and center of their platform selection and due diligence.<br/>We are a bit old fashioned here at FinalytiQ and we happen to believe that ‘a pension/ ISA/GIA on platform is for life’. Or at least it should be.<br/>With a typical client facing a retirement of over 25-30 years, the last thing they want<br/>to have to worry about is the risk that their platform might be shut down, exit the<br/>market or fall behind in terms of technology and service. While the demise of a platform doesn’t pose a direct threat to client assets, lack of profits to reinvest in technology and service delivery hampers an adviser’s ability to deliver on their promises to clients. Platforms are businesses and without profits, it’s hard<br/>to see how a business can continue to exist, compete and serve its customers.We’ve been arguing for some time that AUA is a superficial way for advisers to judge how well a platform is doing. Growth in assets must translate<br/>into bottom-line profit or it’s futile. There’s so much emphasis in the platform sector<br/>on gathering and growing assets that the bottom line neglect is now painfully obvious. We see no direct correlation between AUA and profitability of platforms.When we rank platforms according to their profits, they look very different from when we rank by AUA.<br/>Making profits is not be-all-end-all, but its pretty close to oxygen on the list of basic requirement for long term survival of a platform. It’s in no one’s interest for a platform to fail, shut down or become a ghost town<br/>as a result of falling behind on service and technology. Sustainability of platforms is in the interests of advisers, and clients.<br/>We know from our work with advisers that moving assets from a platform to another costs over £500 per client in administration and paraplanning costs, not counting the<br/>cost of advisers facetime to explain to clients why they have to move from A to B. And the potential damage it does to the trust between adviser and client. We see increasing number of cases where advisers are reluctant to move assets because of the associated cost, and not being able to deliver the highest standard of service they would like.<br/>","7<br/>With a typical client facing a retirement of over 25-30 years, the last thing they want to have to worry about is the risk that their platform might be shut down<br/>The three largest platforms by AUA – Cofunds, FundsNetwork and Old Mutual Wealth - aren’t the largest in terms of bottom-line profit. These are Transact, AJ Bell and 7IM. And 5<br/>out of 10 top ranked platforms by AUA don’t appear among the top ten by profit. Strangely, some of the smaller players in the market like Parmenion and Wealthtime are among the most profitable.<br/>What’s worrying is there are platforms with substantial AUA (over £5 billion) who are<br/>not close to being profitable after several years in the market, let alone recouping their development costs. The question is, at what point do these platforms start to make a profit to keep shareholders committed and to reinvest in technology and service? And for how long will the parent company continue<br/>ask questions; big businesses get reviewed; bean counters are called in; ‘restructuring’ happens and loss-making platforms are at risk of being axed by their parent company.

But they’re also human beings, and this means that there are some things that they all have in common. One of the things that all investors share is a propensity to display certain behavioural biases. The good news is that helping investors to counter these biases is an area where advisers can add substantial value.<br/>coaching is a significant proportion of that added value.<br/>In fact, academic studies have suggested that behavioural coaching can add between 100 and 200 basis points per annum to a client’s performance1 , and our own research points to an average of around 150 basis points over the long term2.<br/>Cognitive and emotional<br/>So what are the most common behavioural biases, and what can advisers do to help mitigate them? There are two types of behavioural bias: cognitive and emotional.<br/>Cognitive biases are errors of logic and you can counter them using data and rational argument. Examples include:<br/>• Confirmation bias (the tendency to notice data that supports our existing view and ignore evidence to the contrary);<br/>• Gambler’s fallacy (a misunderstanding<br/>of probabilities in which people wrongly project reversal to a long-term mean); and<br/>• Anchoring (the common human tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information received).<br/>Emotional biases are tendencies to believe in things that give us a good feeling<br/>and disbelieve things that make us feel uncomfortable. Examples here include:<br/>Every client is different; they have their own experiences, attitudes to risk, goals, and their own required and desired returns. But they’re also human beings, and this means that there are some things that they all have in common. One of the things that all investors share is<br/>a propensity to display certain behavioural biases. The good news is that helping investors to counter these biases is an area where advisers can add substantial value.<br/>Adviser’s Alpha – you make the difference<br/>At Vanguard we’ve researched the difference between the returns that investors might achieve with an adviser’s help and what they might have achieved on their own. We call the difference Adviser’s Alpha and it comes out<br/>at around 3% per annum over the long term (i.e. more than ten years). That’s not 3% every year, because the delivery of the added value can come in fits and starts – more of that later. But over the long term, a good adviser can potentially add in the region of 3% annualised to their client’s returns. And behavioural<br/>","11<br/>• Overconfidence (e.g. most people believe they are better-than-average drivers);<br/>• Loss aversion (the pain of losing money outweighs the pleasure of making money); and<br/>• Groupthink (a psychological phenomenon that occurs within a group of people, in which the desire for harmony or conformity in the group results in an irrational or dysfunctional decision-making outcome).<br/>These are trickier to counter and rely on trust and building a positive long-term relationship.<br/>A real-life example<br/>You might have seen behavioural biases<br/>in action when markets wobbled over the summer. The chart below shows the day- by-day percentage moves in the FTSE All Share from mid-July to early-October. On 21 August the market was down by 2.7% and on the following Monday it fell by a further 4.5%. This might have prompted some investors to sell out.<br/>In the event, the market rose by more than 3% in two of the next three days and, over the subsequent six weeks, posted three further daily gains of more than 2% and four daily losses of more than 2%.<br/>Selling out after a couple of down days is<br/>a classic investment mistake driven by a complex combination of biases, the most predominant of which is loss aversion. Succumbing to these biases can have a big impact on long-term investing success. But a good adviser will have told nervous investors at this time that markets rise and fall, that periods of heightened volatility are normal and that they should remain focused on their long-term goals.<br/>Of course, this is a fairly mild example but<br/>it proves a point. When things get really uncertain, as they did during the financial crisis, behavioural coaching can deliver multiples of the long-term average added value that we discussed earlier.<br/>It works both ways<br/>Behavioural coaching is just as important in the good times. If the markets are up strongly, investors might be tempted to abandon<br/>their plan and take on too much risk, thus exposing their portfolios to a greater impact<br/>if a market correction were to occur. In these circumstances, the same message applies: stick to your plan, remember the long-term role of each asset class, and rebalance back to your original target allocation. Single fund solutions can help by automatically rebalancing – circumventing behavioural biases .<br/>Emotional biases and keeping your clients on course<br/>Reminding clients of their long-term goals can help persuade them not to abandon the plan in emotionally charged markets. It can also be a good remedy for the temptation of chasing the next “hot” investment. This is where the faith and trust that clients have in an adviser is key. By establishing a strong relationship before euphoria or panic challenge the investor’s resolve, the adviser gives him or herself a better chance of being heard when it matters most.<br/>Todd Schlanger, CFA, is an investment strategist in Vanguard’s Investment Strategy Group<br/>1 See, for example, Philip Maymin and Gregg 1<br/>Fisher (2011)<br/>2 See Westaway, Schlanger, Kinniry, Jaconetti and DiJoseph (2014)<br/>3 Vanguard’s LifeStrategy Funds target five different mixes of equities<br/>and bonds and are regularly rebalanced back to their target weights, taking rebalancing decisions out of clients’ hands and helping portfolios to stay in line with their original goals.<br/>Important notes<br/>This article is directed at professional investors and should not be distributed to, or relied upon by retail investors.<br/>This article is designed for use by, and is directed only at persons resident in the UK.<br/>The material contained in this document is not to be regarded as<br/>an offer to buy or sell or the solicitation of any offer to buy or sell securities in any jurisdiction where such an offer or solicitation is against the law, or to anyone to whom it is unlawful to make such an offer or solicitation, or if the person making the offer or solicitation is not qualified to do so.<br/>The information on this document does not constitute legal, tax, or investment advice.

We believe that it is important to view any recent market malaise in the context of prior corrective periods. Since the end of the financial crisis, there has been no lack of concerns to worry about:<br/>moved higher to end up on the year. Rebounds occur for many reasons: economic news, policy response, seasonality etc.<br/>We see recent market turbulence, as an “overdue” market correction, part and parcel of investing in financial markets, but not the beginnings of a global bear market in risk assets. Bear markets occur when economies are in recession. Our economic outlook acknowledges the slowdown in China and<br/>its reverberations across swaths of industrial, resource and emerging economies. However, we still see good recovery prospects in the US, UK, Europe and Japan. Our base case remains that we are in an elongated cyclical recovery from the 2008 financial lows. We recognise that this recovery is more muted and fragile than in the past, but also think its pattern resonates with prior periods of low inflation. In the past, low inflation recoveries have been more fragile and susceptible to growth scares. The recovery periods also tend to last longer, 33 quarters on average. This could well mean a further 2-4 years to the current expansion phase, perhaps even to the year 2020.<br/>We have avoided the worst of the turmoil with little direct exposure to commodity based emerging markets, material or resource shares. We are cautious, but also looking for opportunities to add to long-term, attractive shares with excellent fundamentals. We believe<br/>• The Eurozone crisis of 2011, where a break-up of the Eurozone had systemic implications given the then fragility of European banks.<br/>• Geopolitics: Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the surge of ISIS and unrest in the Middle East.<br/>• One off crises: The Japanese earthquake and Ebola scare.<br/>Despite what were seen as alarming events<br/>at the time, equity markets in the main rebounded after a corrective phase. Indeed, research shows that if an investor misses the best 20 days in equity markets, long term returns are greatly reduced. Using returns from the FTSE 100 from 1995 to end 2014 by way of example, the long term annualised return over this period is 7.3%. During this time,<br/>there are manifold periods of market decline. However, if an investor missed the best 20 trading days, by being out of the market when the rebound occurred, the return profile is greatly diminished, falling from 7.3% to 1.5%. Since one can never predict the timing of a ‘rebound’ with precision, we encourage our clients to remain long term equity investors.<br/>Market volatility, moreover, is historically normal and - statistically speaking - a regular occurrence. Using returns from the S&P 500 by way of example and looking back over 35 years, intra-year corrections occur with regularity, usually at least once a year. In fact until last August, the US market had been experiencing the longest period without a 10% correction in over 3 years. However in 27 of the last 35 years or close to 80% of the time, market corrections were unwound within 2-4 months. Typically markets recovered all the lost ground and<br/>","13<br/>Market volatility, moreover, is historically normal and - statistically speaking - a regular occurrence.

Our sector focus is diverse but focused on areas where we can find top line growth and improving prospects ahead. Some of the sectors that we like in the current environment include:<br/>• Health care: where strong product innovation in many firms is combined with growing demand and industry consolidation to underpin strong long term growth. Price caps and other pressure on product costs remain a potential threat but we still see overwhelming growth benefit from innovation, consolidation and demographic demand.<br/>• Consumer discretionary segment in the developed world is benefiting from clear<br/>signs of a consumer recovery and pent-up demand from prior belt tightening years. We like shares which benefit from the more cost conscious consumer in the growing ‘fast fashion’ segment as well as shares exposed to increased expenditure in travel and leisure.<br/>• Technology remains an area of selective focus.We like companies benefiting from a pickup in enterprise spend, particularly in keys areas of broadband, the Cloud and cyber security.<br/>• Select financials we like companies benefiting from rising volumes in operationally geared business models. The move to more spending on the Internet and a cash-less society are also themes reflected in portfolios.<br/>profile for 2015 to be more muted than originally hoped. Gains are likely to come from equities, where we expect modest earning growth and dividends to be the drivers of return.<br/>We remain of the view that judicious and prudent selection of great companies, with sound balances sheets, cash flow and growing dividends with strong and growing businesses will serve our client portfolios well over time.<br/>How Close Brothers Asset Management can help<br/>Volatility can be managed through a disciplined investment process, like the one we have spent years developing and refining at Close Brothers Asset Management. We believe that the best way to deliver returns greater than inflation and reduce risk is through diversification: investing across asset classes,<br/>global regions and types of investments.<br/>We invest predominantly in liquid shares because it allows us to respond to changing market conditions quickly and enables us<br/>to meet growth, income and drawdown needs of our clients. We offer a range actively managed portfolios, each aligned to a specific investment objective and attitude to risk.<br/>In a low growth and low interest rate world, where bonds and cash deliver little by way of return, we believe future returns and portfolio growth will largely be driven by stock selection.<br/>Industrial shares have been under pressure and we are generally cautious. On any improvement in economic data, we think certain shares could be attractive and are refreshing our target buy ideas.<br/>Overall we anticipate a better fourth quarter for economic data, corporate earnings and risk asset returns.

In this article we look at some of the results.<br/>Good news<br/>69% of customers took all of their Royal London pension as a lump sum.<br/>This figure is relatively high, however it must be remembered that this option was not available prior to April and it is likely that there was some pent up demand. Our expectation is that the percentage of those taking full withdrawal will fall.<br/>The average lump sum withdrawn was £15,500.<br/>The average sum taken is relatively low and represents a fund value that probably wouldn’t be able to generate a significant amount of lifetime income. The research also showed that 68% of customers who answered said their Royal London pension would contribute less than 25% of their overall retirement income. Presumably therefore customers would still have these other sources of income available at retirement.<br/>There are very few customers looking to withdraw their money and re-invest it in, say, buy-to-let property<br/>Just so we know we are asking he right questions, can you tell me what percentage have you taken / decided to take as a lump sum?<br/>Base: All respondants (800)<br/>","15<br/>There is little doubt that the new pension freedoms are a good thing. But there is still a long way to go in making sure that the people who want to take advantage of them can do so at a reasonable cost while protecting them against detrimental decisions.<br/>85% of Royal London customers rated the call 8 or more out of 10.<br/>Feedback indicated that the majority of customers believed that their options had been clearly explained, that all their questions had been answered and that they received enough information to make an informed decision.<br/>There is a slight caveat though - the majority of customers asked (70%) had already decided what they wanted to do with the money.

As a result, new innovative product solutions are beginning to appear. Amongst those is The Retirement Account – a new retirement income option introduced by Retirement Advantage to help people<br/>make the most of their new-found freedom.<br/>mostly in drawdown in their younger years, then gradually buying slices of annuity as they get older and want less investment risk.<br/>In addition, there is much more control<br/>and flexibility when the customer dies. The Retirement Account allows beneficiaries to receive any death benefits – for example, the remaining drawdown fund and any attaching benefits to the annuity such as guarantees<br/>up to 30 years and value protection – in their own Retirement Account. Money can then be withdrawn by the beneficiary when it suits, or gradually over a period of time. In either case, cascading funds to family in a tax efficient way.<br/>All of this flexibility is delivered in a simple cost-effective solution, which can be tailored to an individual customer’s circumstances. With the annuity income taking into account their health and lifestyle. And a range of top- class active and passive investment funds for the drawdown element. Now you can offer customers the certainty of an annuity and the flexibility of drawdown in a simple way. The retirement income solution for the new world has arrived.<br/>The value of investments may go down as well as up. Taking income in excess of the growth in the value of the Pension Funds may result in income running out quicker than expected. Taxation rules and regulations may change in the future. Inflation will reduce how much your income is worth over the years.<br/>Retirement Advantage is a trading name of MGM Advantage Life Limited. Authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority.<br/>Traditionally people had to choose between the flexibility and control of income drawdown, and the guaranteed income for life provided<br/>by an annuity. The Retirement Account offers these side-by-side within one tax-advantaged wrapper, giving people the best of both worlds.<br/>People have always had the option of using their pension pot to buy some annuity while investing the remaining amount in drawdown. But, especially for pots below £250,000, this has rarely been used as it creates double the work and flexibility is limited.<br/>The Retirement Account offers a drawdown solution incorporating a traditional drawdown pot, a cash account and a guaranteed annuity. The customer – in conjunction with their adviser - can choose at outset how much to invest in each element and change this balance<br/>over time to meet their changing needs as they move through later life.<br/>This is a single product – one illustration,<br/>one application form, one income payment<br/>to the customer and one annual statement, simplifying administration and paperwork for both customer and adviser. Uniting these two elements within one account means customers can choose to reduce, increase or even stop the income they receive from the annuity.<br/>Any surplus income is reinvested within the drawdown element to be used at a later date. As it stays within the pension wrapper no tax is payable until it is withdrawn, giving maximum flexibility and control to plan income to suit individual circumstances.<br/>Further tranches of annuity can be bought over time, allowing people to start off fully or<br/>","NOW YOU CAN COMBINE ANNUITIES & DRAWDOWN IN A SINGLE TAX-ADVANTAGED WRAPPER The Retirement Account<br/>17<br/>Call us on 0800 023 2506<br/>or visit retirementadvantage.com/adviser<br/>to find out more and get your Retirement Account toolkit<br/>Telephone calls may be recorded for training and quality monitoring purposes.

However, with so much uncertainty weighing on investor sentiment at the moment, we expect sentiment-driven volatility to persist. In such an environment, we believe it is more important than ever to maintain focus on fundamentals, in terms of what trends in data are telling us about the health of the global economy. Nothing we have seen in recent data has prompted us to materially reassess our view that the global economy is growing at a moderate pace, while inflation remains low.<br/>Volatility persists<br/>The period since our last update in July was largely characterised by significant market volatility across asset classes. This meant there have been few hiding places even for well- diversified multi-asset funds.<br/>It seems a long time ago now, though it was just a few months, that Greece was dominating headlines. As is often the case, since July we have seen market attention shift suddenly from one issue to another, sometimes over a matter of days. So it may feel as if a lot has happened, even though there has in fact been little evidence of material change to underlying economic fundamentals globally.<br/>Instead, we have seen what we believe<br/>are sentiment-driven movements in asset pricing, in developed markets at least, where fundamentals remain encouraging. In the<br/>our view, this volatility has largely been an overreaction to the lack of transparency about US policy and geopolitical events paired with China’s fairly modest currency devaluation and signs of ongoing Chinese economic slowdown.<br/>We believe the clearest explanation for this is that there is a general absence of faith in sustainable global growth. This is manifesting itself as confusion among investors over how to value assets.<br/>Investors today face an uncertain environment. We have just experienced an extraordinary phase in financial markets. Investors remain rattled by the shock of 2008 and this has meaningfully skewed perceptions of risk.<br/>Coupled with the unprecedented intervention of central bankers in recent years – and the potentially huge disruption that removal of this intervention could cause – this leaves asset pricing still significantly distorted. In our view, all this uncertainty, and the volatility it is driving, could present a fertile investment landscape.<br/>","Global divergence<br/>Figure 2: Price action inconsistent with fundamentals<br/>on fundamentals. Our view remains that the global economy is growing at a moderate pace, while inflation remains low and leaves us comfortable with portfolios positioned in a modestly ‘pro-risk’ direction.<br/>When we look at the global economic<br/>landscape today, we see a major division<br/>between Asia and emerging markets, on one 200 side, and the US and Europe, on the other.<br/>n<br/>g<br/>continues to indicate robust recovery (see<br/>ew<br/>sco<br/>min<br/>out o<br/>f the<br/>US an<br/>dE<br/>uro<br/>p<br/>e<br/>0 for the opportunities this could present.

In the M&G Multi Asset team, we often talk about the ‘disconnect’ between price movements and genuine changes in the facts, and this has been clearly evident since July.<br/>Opportunities and risks<br/>So while we acknowledge genuine risks in certain parts of the world, the volatility seen across developed market equities during late summer seemed an inconsistent response when we consider the material improvement seen in fundamental factors such as earnings (see figure 2). For us, this represented an opportunity to tactically increase equity exposure in these regions.<br/>Overall, although our broad central observation remains the attractiveness of equities versus bonds, regional divergence in terms of both price action and fundamentals highlights the importance of being selective. Currently, two of our preferred areas are European equity<br/>– where we are offered attractive valuations with scope for further recovery, and US banks – a sector which is offering better value than the broad US market and should provide some useful diversification in a rising rate environment.<br/>Focus on fundamentals<br/>Since the end of the third quarter, risk assets have bounced back significantly from what we believe to be the oversold levels of previous months. However, this just further highlights how markets have experienced dramatic short-term swings in price, on very little news recently. There is nothing we could point to, in terms of changes in data trends, since the end of September as justification for this reversal.<br/>Instead, global policy remains the dominant topic. Investors have set themselves in ‘policy watch’ mode. So, from this point, even a small surprise from the central banks could trigger significant price action.<br/>All of this means that we find ourselves in an environment that appears unstable, with a great deal of focus on what policymakers will do next, particularly in terms of the historically low cash rates that have affected asset prices across the global investment universe. In<br/>such an environment, we believe it is more important than ever to increase our focus<br/>19<br/>12-month forward earnings per share<br/>","20<br/>Overloaded! Can We Really Understand All of This Information?<br/>Ben Kumar | Investment Manager | Seven Investment Management<br/>In the haste to give the world data, GDP<br/>figures are rushed out within a month of the<br/>quarter ending, which leads to multiple GDP<br/>releases.Yetthisfirstreading(or‘shotinthe<br/>dark’) often moves markets significantly as<br/>owned), precisely because these types of companies think in terms of decades rather than months.<br/>Academic research has repeatedly supported this view, with one survey of CEOs and CFOs findingthat80%werewillingtoforgoresearch and development spending and 55% to delay promising long-term projects, in order to avoid missing quarterly earnings estimates!<br/>Regulatory bodies are coming around too – since 2013 quarterly reporting is no longer mandatory for companies based in the European Union, and listed on the London Stock Exchange is in a similar position.<br/>Finally (and perhaps inevitably) the issue has recently become political, with Hillary Clinton making criticism of “quarterly capitalism” one of her key presidential campaign issues.<br/>Focussing less on short term results seems like common sense – everyone knows it is harder to achieve something with someone looking over your shoulder the whole time. Clearly, there is some change going on in the corporate world to address this, and we’re likely to see more and more. It’s always comforting to know that a problem has been identified, and that solutions are being considered.<br/>investors react.<br/>A regular criticism of the current financial state of play is that quarterly reporting is not helpful. It seems odd to say in the modern world of big data, but there really is a genuine argument that less is more.<br/>Collecting three month data is difficult, and collecting meaningful three month data even more so. One-off events are magnified in importance thanks to the short frame<br/>of reference. As a simple example, take the London tube strike where access to the capital was incredibly difficult for over 24 hours in August. That missed summer shopping day will have hurt retailers – but over the course of a year is going to be lost in the noise. However when viewed on a quarterly basis (i.e. 60 working days), that one poor day represents nearly 2% of the data collected –<br/>more than enough to give a negative skew to that period’s numbers. Issuing a statement every three months is an expensive and complicated undertaking that is rarely that informative, and is occasionally harmful, for the company involved.<br/>Some market participants clearly sympathise with this. Increasingly when public companies are taken private, avoiding short-termism<br/>is cited as a key reason – Michael Dell, on taking his PC maker private once more in 2013, emphasised the benefits of being able to function “without the scrutiny, quarterly targets and other limitations of operating as a public company”. In a similar vein, many investors have long favoured European companies that have a small concentrated majority shareholder base (i.e. are family<br/>","21<br/>If companies find it expensive and difficult to collect data on their own business, how much more difficult must it be for government employees to come up with a quarterly GDP figure?<br/>What bothers me though is that the quarterly economic data cycle is not undergoing the same kind of scrutiny. If companies find it expensive and difficult to collect data on their own business, how much more difficult must it be for government employees to come up with a quarterly GDP figure? At least as a company, there is cash in the bank, products in the warehouse and receipts in the till. The same cannot be said for a nation!<br/>Let’s use an often quoted number to demonstrate – GDP growth. In the haste to give the world data, GDP figures are rushed out<br/>within a month of the quarter ending, which leads to multiple GDP releases – the initial estimate, and then two or more revisions.<br/>In the UK, the first estimate is made with less than 40% of the information used in the final reading. Yet this first reading (or ‘shot in the dark’) often moves markets significantly as investors react. To draw a parallel – that’s like a bookmaker paying out on a football match after the 36th minute, just assuming the score will stay the same.<br/>In addition, the final figure is on average 1%<br/>different to the initial one. In a world where 2% GDP growth is considered impressive, that 1% margin of error is incredibly high. Evidently, asking statistics agencies to work on a three month cycle results in quicker results, but which are unreliable (at best). Given that statistical analysis depends largely on the quality of the data, this focus on speed seems slightly contrary to me.<br/>Perhaps in another piece, I’ll explore how tricky the collection of information is, but here I’m mainly concerned with the frequency of the publication. I’m firmly of the belief<br/>that the onus on reporting GDP figures (or employment, or inflation, or productivity, or...) every three months is damaging and misleading. Don’t get me started on monthly or weekly data production. Big data is all very well, but there has to be some information content – otherwise, we’re producing static, rather than statistics.<br/>Ben Kumar Investment Manager<br/>","22<br/>Spotlight on Synaptic Comparator<br/>Stephanie Hydon | Sales Executive | Synaptic Software Limited<br/>Steph Hydon considers the Due Diligence secret weapon that removes uncertainty around cost and helps prove Suitability in investment and evidence your expertise as an adviser.<br/>There are several massive trends affecting the product recommendations that you as advisers are making.<br/>In such a fast moving environment, it is essential for all advisers to be sure that they understand what is available in the market and crucially ‘how much it costs’.<br/>the board is absolute.

We assumed that he was trying to make the point that his clients love the strategies he finesses around their<br/>life goals or the structure he builds into their otherwise chaotic lives, but to us, reducing the role of investment performance negates the importance in risk in achieving investment returns or retirement income. Nothing is more important in financial planning than understanding the role of risk in the context of investment.<br/>There are actually very few consistently successful investment strategies – and even the most celebrated proponents from Buffett to Paulson, Woodford to Bolton have all had their purple patches but also their anni horribili. Why should we be any different? There is no such thing as a risk free investment, or for<br/>that matter a safe haven. Even if your client has oodles of money, it will have to be parked<br/>or put to work somewhere, and risk will be a determinant to the strategy, even if it is just a review of the most reliable bank deposit holders in the market.<br/>So having a handle on risk is the basic requirement of investment, and comes as a two sided coin – what is my client’s risk profile, and what is the risk profile attached to my investment.. and do they fit?<br/>Traditionally, volatility relating to asset valuations was used, more or less as a proxy for risk. Gilts ran with the lowest volatility (after cash) and emerging markets equities the most. Everything sat in between. A diversified portfolio balanced between equities and fixed income would be fine, given that when equities tanked, bonds rise and vice versa. The problem is now, volatility is breaking out in different areas making it a less reliable measure of likely returns, and in times of stress, everything<br/>tanks at the same time. Investment returns have been distorted by politically motivated intervention by central banks. So there are no simple investment strategies.<br/>The second challenge for advisers is to set<br/>up a process that is transparent, robust and repeatable. This implies the need for there<br/>to be objective research that goes beyond Volatitlity or simple ‘drawdown’ measurements. This doesn’t mean that your favourite and proven strategies are inadequate, rather that you now need more granular research to support their recommendation.<br/>There is an elegant way of overcoming these multiple challenges - by accessing one of the leading stochastic engines, and in our view the Moody’s Analytics is the superior and proven article. The assumptions in the model have stood up to the test of time – as in retrospect, the model has been accurate. The engine will allow you to project actual holdings as well<br/>as notional recommendations, and assign probabilities to the full range of outcomes as mapped out by the Monte Carlo simulation.<br/>As well as taking a non-deterministic approach to inflation, another crucial advantage is<br/>that the projection of asset classes does take relative performance of asset classes into account. The multiple scenarios generated do look at many different growth trajectories for various assets and how they may affect each other. For example in a scenario where Sterling Bonds have shot out the lights, the model will explore the likelihood of problems in other asset classes.<br/>The obvious criticism is that ultimately the model is dependent on the assumptions that underpin it, and of course this is true. But we would argue that the Monte Carlo simulation moves the exercise from the realm of the unusable to the useful.<br/>Qualitative research and experience are<br/>as relevant as ever, but now the financial planner has access to a risk framework that facilitates the most difficult of conversations – quantifying a client’s ‘Capacity’ and ‘Tolerance’ for ‘Loss’ based on probability.

And often, the case against advisers failing to demonstrate the suitability of their investment advice adequately is really rather strong.<br/>Very few advisers willfully fail to align their investment process to suit their clients’ needs, but when it comes to evidencing suitability in an adequate manner and justifying their value to the client – many fall short. This is especially the case in this new advisory environment where the use of a centralised investment proposition is commonplace.<br/>Firms build suitability reports that mainly cover the firm’s advice policy and are only sometimes focused on the client’s specific investment needs. And while these reports are created with the best of intentions, officials at the FCA are still concerned over such standardised reporting.<br/>Speaking at a conference held by Thesis Asset Management at the start of this year, Rory Percival from the FCA urged advisers to rely less on repetitive template reports and to create more ‘’personalised reports based on the client’’.<br/>By the regulator’s standards - a good suitability report should include the client’s objectives, demonstrate why a recommendation is suitable for that individual client, outline<br/>any and all potential disadvantages and, importantly, this should be communicated to the client in a manner that is understandable and effective in explaining any complexities.<br/>The discussion should conclude with the client expressing an understanding that the portfolio meets their objectives, the risk taken required to meet these objectives and their capacity for risk.<br/>Ensuring clients understand the risk they are taking on may require a process of client education and testing for understanding, using additional questions and affirmations on an ongoing basis.<br/>This, while time-consuming - is not just a defensive move by the adviser but a source<br/>of added value and coaching to the client<br/>on an ongoing basis in the light of changing market conditions and personal circumstances. Something that is highly valuable and will highlight that advisers have a continued role<br/>in the future of financial planning in this landscape where the threat of the robo-adviser seems to worry many in the industry.<br/>The risk problem<br/>In order to build a ‘suitable’ suitability report you need to have a detailed understanding of the client’s attitude to risk and time-bound objectives. In order to do this, to need to check that your client understands just how important it is that they adequately articulate their risk levels and the adviser interprets them correctly.<br/>The regulator suggests that best practice in this area is to provide clients with a reasonably good idea of what risk they are signing up to<br/>- prior to assigning a score or level. By using a good risk profiler tool aligned with investment forecasting capabilities advisers can easily map client risk levels to sample asset allocations or models that can then be charted.<br/>Note that the regulator has also stated that advisers need to be aware of the risks tool they use and are aware of any weaknesses they may have.<br/>Using the right tools should help your client understand and visualise the consequence of risk on possible future returns and will also provide a realistic view of the scope of their objectives. It is also a good idea to run through a form of stress testing/scenario testing with your client – to really make them aware of just what can happen.<br/>","Building your investment proposition<br/>The regulator FCA has warned that firms should beware of ‘retro- fitting’ whilst choosing a CIP - when an advice firm goes through<br/>the selection process for a proposition but is geared towards what the firm wants to use or is already using.<br/>In other words, whether you outsource your process or rely on good old self- selection of funds essential not just to establish a verified audit trail but also show the impact of your recommendations on the client’s specific objectives.<br/>By using an independent data resource<br/>and conducting extensive due-diligence on solutions you can build your proposition in a sophisticated manner to prove to the regulator that you are not shoe- horning clients into a pre-determined solution.<br/>Communicate effectively<br/>A good client service proposition will empower the investor by giving them a good understanding of their financial situation.<br/>But more often than not explaining complex financial terms to inexperienced clients can be challenging and in some serious cases lead to misinterpretation of advice.<br/>Remember that care should be taken to provide clients with timely reports that are clear, concise and jargon free.<br/>Advisers can stay ahead of the curve by the intelligent use of KIID documents, glossaries, charts and interactive graphs.<br/>Explaining risk to your clients with FE Risk Score charting<br/>It can be tricky to monitor the risk of a client’s portfolio; especially when considering how the risk levels are, more often than not, likely to change over time.<br/>FE Risk Scores provide a single, easy-to-<br/>understand measure of risk across a broad<br/>range of investments.

It is amazing to witness the rare confluence of Providers’ plans, intermediaries’ preferences and consumer appetite - all in virtuous alignment. These products are being made to order, are a joy to recommend and are flying off the shelves.<br/>When we crunch the data relating to recommendations made through the Synaptic system we see the following: a majority of funds flowing into the ‘multi-asset’ arena.<br/>This underlines the fact that ‘multi-asset’ investing is not just a catch-all for customers with smaller amounts to invest, but are a<br/>core investment solution for a wider range of cases, including single premium bond / ISA and pension investments.<br/>","We have been reading this week about the FCA’s concerns about the lack of consistency in advice. For us this points to the difficulty that some firms are having in setting up robust due diligence, and establishing best practice. Some of our best customers have only come to us after they have been censured by the FCA for example.You must have the ability to evaluate investments in depth, including a full range of risk metrics andassetallocation.Youneedtobeableto do research in the context of the products and platforms that are being recommended. You need to be able to maintain portfolios for research purposes so as not to rely exclusively on information from the Providers. Finally you need to be able to conduct independent risk assessments of your clients and their investments, preferably with access to stochastic metrics.<br/>The Due Diligence points are really the same as for any portfolio. Multi-asset investments still require you to understand how and where the money is invested. So if you<br/>can’t see a breakdown – you should almost certainly avoid.<br/>The fund should reflect your firm’s investment strategy, in terms of diversification of asset classes and investment themes. As many of the funds are relatively new, you may need to concentrate on those that have a greater track record, including performance through difficult market conditions.<br/>The freedom that a multi-asset proposition can exercise is a potent weapon in today’s markets. The markets have benefitted greatly from artificial liquidity since the downturn, but as macro policy is shifting among<br/>the big economies, bouts of volatility are revealing areas of real vulnerability relating to correlation and liquidity risks. Multi-asset funds are starting to fill the gaps where straight forward allocation to fixed income would have once worked, but alas is no longer an easy option. Many fixed income instruments are now too expensive, illiquid and volatile. The wider remit and flexibility<br/>of the multi-asset manager is the key to navigating the topsy-turvy markets we are in. The many funds that are managed to a risk profile become ready-made solutions that align beautifully with a client’s appetite for risk, as explored with their adviser.<br/>Moreover the portfolio administration overhead is removed from the adviser.<br/>We have been performing due diligence<br/>on funds from Canada Life, Fidelity, L&G<br/>IM, M&G, Prudential, Premier, Rathbones, Royal London,Vanguard Sanlam and Santander in recent months, and there are some truly outstanding ranges to choose from. Exclusively passive solutions are also available and over all, ongoing costs are easily comparable to traditional model portfolios. Clearly the compliance overhead is low, as the fund can be analysed as a single entity.<br/>Below - I have built the following grid in Synaptic Product and Fund, providing a table that I can sort across a variety of metrics prior to selection. As with risk, qualitative research (or opinion!) should not take precedence over quant analysis. The FCA is concerned about the consistency of advice within groups of advisers, but we think that a focus on how research is performed should make it easier to establish parameters for consistency and best advice.<br/>Eric Armstrong<br/>Product Marketing Synaptic Software Limited<br/>35<br/>Synaptic Guide to Multi Asset Funds<br/>","36<br/>Synaptic Guide to Multi Asset Funds<br/>Multi Asset Investing – Diversification<br/>Multi asset investing has many attractions from an advisers perspective – it is a way<br/>of outsourcing the ongoing management<br/>of client funds in a cost effective way – and key to this are the diversification benefits it brings, not just in the initial portfolio but on an ongoing basis through the fund management and rebalancing.<br/>market, economy or country, and it can be reduced through diversification. The most common sources of unsystematic risk are business risk and financial risk.<br/>A diversified portfolio will invest in a range of assets so that not all will be affected in the same way by market events. In simple terms, the more concentrated a portfolio, the greater risk there is that if a negative event occurs affecting markets related to the assets you are holding, then they could all fall in value. If this risk has been spread by holding non correlated assets – that is those which react in a different way to the event - the chances of significant loss are lower. There are always exceptions to this, such as a crisis that transcends all of these normal correlations, as we saw with the 2008 global financial crisis.<br/>The benefits of diversification are perhaps best illustrated with an example. If a portfolio were held in only one type of stock – for example airline stocks – and an event occurred affecting that industry – for example an indefinite strike by aircraft staff – then the share prices of all the stocks will drop, having a dramatic effect on the entire portfolio. If however the portfolio also held some stocks to counterbalance this risk, for example rail company stocks, then only part of the portfolio would be affected, and indeed the rail company stocks may increase as a result of higher demand for its services.<br/>Diversification is a subject which investors should have high up on their agenda when planning a portfolio and most investors understand the principle - which is to spread assets across a number of different asset classes, sectors and geographies to deliver<br/>the best return for a given level of risk. Combinations of assets that do this are said to be on the efficient frontier as defined by Harry Markowitz in 1952 - this is the cornerstone of what is called Modern Portfolio Theory. The efficient frontier is the point where a portfolio reaches its optimal combination of assets<br/>to achieve the best return for the risk taken. We will not dwell too long on this, only to understand that in investment theory at least diversification is at the heart of maximising risk and return.<br/>Diversification is key to managing risk in a portfolio, and so to understand this we need to look more closely at risk, and the different types investors are exposed to. Fundamentally there are two types of risk to address. Firstly systematic or ‘market risk’, which is a risk<br/>that diversification cannot address and it is associated with every type of asset. Causes of systematic risk are things like inflation rates, exchange rates, political instability, war and interest rates. This type of risk is not specific to a particular company or industry, and it cannot be eliminated, or reduced through diversification; it is just a risk that investors must accept.<br/>The second type of risk is unsystematic risk and this is specific to a company, industry,<br/>","Of course it is possible, and indeed preferable, to diversify further than this - as there are many events that would affect all transport stocks. This is the impact of correlation.<br/>Any event that reduced travel overall would affect the whole portfolio, so it would be argued that train and air travel stocks have strong correlation. In order to achieve better diversification, you would want to diversify more comprehensively, not only investing<br/>in different types of companies but also in different types of industries. The more uncorrelated the stocks are, the better.<br/>even companies if direct equities are included) and potentially other levels in between. Diversification is simple to understand but far more difficult to deliver effectively.<br/>Once a portfolio is in place, it is just as important to monitor it, and look at the attribution (how and why a portfolio differed from its benchmark) as this can illustrate where there are biases and unintended risks in a portfolio. Holding a range of mutual funds from different managers may seem to offer diversification but if all the managers have 10% in Vodafone for example, then the<br/>away from this style the portfolio could perform much worse than one which included a range of styles.<br/>Portfolio construction is a careful balancing act, as it is also not wise to over diversify as this can work against a portfolio as well. Splitting<br/>a portfolio into many small packages can incur higher transaction costs and can mean that the holdings are so small that the portfolio doesn’t really benefit from holding the right stocks as they are in too small a quantity to influence the overall return.<br/>In summary, the principle of diversification is generally well understood and is a vital part of portfolio planning. This simple initial message is however much more complex when looking to execute effectively to meet different client requirements. This is where multi asset funds run by professional fund management groups can help to deliver the right level of risk adjusted returns.<br/>Ken Rayner<br/>RSMR November 2015<br/>In simple terms, the more concentrated a portfolio, the greater risk there is that if a negative event occurs affecting markets related to the assets you are holding, then they could all fall in value.<br/>Constructing a diversified portfolio involves a number of layers, from the macro or headline level - choosing between equity, bonds, property, cash, commodities, and alternatives – to decisions on geography, and ultimately decisions on individual sectors and funds (or<br/>underlying concentration risk may be higher than first thought. Similarly, holding funds from a number of managers with the same or similar style or process would not represent<br/>a diversified portfolio as the funds would be highly correlated and if the market moved<br/>37<br/>Diversification is key to managing risk in a portfolio, and so to understand this we need to look more closely at risk, and the different types investors are exposed to.<br/>Synaptic Guide to Multi Asset Funds<br/>","38<br/>Synaptic Guide to Multi Asset Funds<br/>Understanding the true cost of investing in multi-asset and multi-manager funds<br/>The use of multi-asset funds has increased substantially in recent years. This trend has been driven by the desire to obtain long- term investment growth similar to that of equities, but with significantly lower volatility.<br/>The underlying costs of these funds are often overlooked, but should be a crucial factor in investors’ selection process.<br/>Looking beyond headline charges<br/>The Retail Distribution Review (RDR)<br/>has served to make advisers and clients increasingly aware of how higher charges can weigh on long-term investment performance. Indeed, traditional ways of expressing charges, such as the annual management charge (AMC),<br/>may not give you the whole picture when it comes to providing a true reflection of the cost to the end consumer.<br/>The total expense ratio (TER) and the more recent Ongoing Charges Figure (OCF) are more accurate measures of the total charges as they include items such as legal, custody and audit fees. However, even these measures only cover headline investment charges and do not capture the other costs of investing.When analysing a multi-asset fund, for example, investors may also wish to consider fund costs in three other areas:<br/>• the turnover costs of changing the funds held • the trading costs within the underlying funds • the cost of any derivatives exposure<br/>Turnover costs of changing underlying funds<br/>Trading costs are the most obvious example of costs that are not captured by the AMC, TER or OCF. While it’s difficult to obtain precise figures, as fund turnover varies over time and from one manager to another, we believe that these are important costs to consider.<br/>Switching exposure between asset classes or markets, for example by switching from UK to European equities, is one of the main ways<br/>that managers aim to add incremental returns. Even the most effective active manager won’t be right with every trade, but each trade does incur transaction costs. These transaction costs are based on the difference between<br/>the buying and selling prices of investments (known as the ‘bid/offer spread’). Where actively managed funds are bought as part of the overall multi-asset fund, it is also likely that there will be occasional costs from switching assets from one manager to another.<br/>A multi-asset fund that uses inexpensive, in-house passive funds avoids the majority<br/>of these costs. It will therefore be likely to incur significantly lower costs than one using external active funds or Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). Furthermore, if managers have a wide range of liquid funds, the use of ‘crossing’ can help to reduce these costs further. Crossing is the in-house process of matching buyers and sellers of these underlying internal funds so that each side can avoid costs by trading at the ‘mid’ price.<br/>Turnover costs within underlying funds<br/>The funds held within a multi-asset fund also incur transaction costs.While both index and active funds incur these costs, they are typically much higher for active funds, as the<br/>","managers change their views over time. This implies a considerable saving for multi-asset funds using index tracker funds for their underlying investment exposure.<br/>Derivatives: The cost of flexibility<br/>Most multi-asset funds use derivatives to take shorter-term positions that might be very expensive or time-consuming to undertake with physical assets. While derivatives can provide this important and useful flexibility, they can incur significant additional costs. Most multi-asset funds make use of both exchange-traded and over-the-counter derivatives such as futures, options, and total return swaps (TRS).<br/>For example, exposure gained through futures and TRS tend to give a slightly lower return than the equivalent holding in the underlying asset. This is because of the funding charges banks generally make for providing them. These funding charges consist of the derivative funding cost, as well as the difference between the cost of the three-month cash rate (on which futures are based) and the lower cost of the one-week cash rate (against which most cash funds are benchmarked). There can also be costs relating to the clearing, execution and margin-interest costs associated with the use of derivatives.<br/>When taking shorter-term positions it may<br/>still be more efficient to use derivatives<br/>than physical assets, due to lower initial trading costs in many cases. However, it is important to note the implied cost of assessing alternative strategies.<br/>Making an informed investment decision<br/>The combination of headline costs included in the TER and underlying trading and derivative costs can have a major impact on returns received by a multi-asset investor over the long run. However, the presence of ‘hidden’ costs can make it difficult to assess the total costs<br/>of a multi-asset fund, particularly where more complex strategies are involved. The benefits of these strategies are often well articulated, but the costs are often overlooked.<br/>Assessing a manager’s ability to generate returns and manage risk is clearly central to fund selection. When doing the due diligence research on a given fund for your clients, however, we also believe that it is crucial<br/>to take an in-depth look at all of the costs incurred in executing a fund manager’s strategy.<br/>Justin Onuekwusi<br/>Fund Manager<br/>Legal & General Investment Management<br/>Contact Us<br/>For further information about our Multi-Asset funds<br/>T: 0345 070 8684*<br/>E: fundsales@lgim.com<br/>Web: www.lgim.com/multi-index<br/>This is not a consumer advertisement.

With an ever increasing regulatory focus on client suitability, it’s more important than ever for advisers and the press to clearly differentiate between the two.<br/>Risk rating vs. risk targeting<br/>Any fund can receive a ‘risk rating’ from an independent risk profiling agency. However, very few funds have an explicit mandate<br/>to maintain this rating. Normally, funds<br/>have other targets, such as outperforming a benchmark. Over time, they can succeed or fail in meeting this target, but either way, they can, and often do, drift away from their original risk rating. This poses a challenge for advisers who must continually reassess whether the fund remains suitable for a given client’s risk profile.<br/>‘Risk-targeted’ funds aim to match a specific risk profile over time, while delivering strong risk-adjusted returns. Doing this successfully requires the fund to adapt the asset allocation in the face of developing trends. Even as the markets cycle through bull and bear phases, the risk profile of a risk-targeted fund should remain consistent. This allows advisers to align the risk attitude of their clients to the funds’ and hopefully avoid any nasty surprises.<br/>Risk targeting: Solving the suitability dilemma<br/>Risk-targeted multi-asset funds represent the next generation of multi-asset investment solutions, and it’s no surprise that they continue to grow in number and AUM. If these funds succeed in being consistent with specific risk profiles, the adviser and their client will both have peace of mind that, as long as the client’s attitude to risk doesn’t change, the funds should remain suitable.<br/>Justin Onuekwusi<br/>Fund Manager<br/>Legal & General Investment Management<br/>Contact Us<br/>For further information about our Multi-Asset funds<br/>T: 0345 070 8684*<br/>E: fundsales@lgim.com<br/>Web: www.lgim.com/multi-index<br/>This is not a consumer advertisement.

In recent years, this perceived ‘safe asset’ has been in high demand as investors, fearing the worst from equity markets and declining growth expectations, sought to avoid risk.<br/>But with an interest rate increase seeming almost inevitable soon, the economic picture does not look positive for bonds on a forward- looking basis.<br/>So if traditional fixed income cannot provide the required risk/return profile, are there other assets that can?<br/>We would highlight select absolute return products as a realistic option, and whilst we cannot guarantee, as with any investment, that these will make money, they do have the ability to deliver real long-term positive returns, something the richly valued bond markets may struggle to do from here.<br/>Unlike long-only fixed income funds, absolute return strategies can invest across a wide array of asset classes as well as utilising derivatives. These instruments are not used to inflate returns, but rather to limit the risks associated with investing in global markets. To capture this, GAM's risk-rated model portfolios invest in a range of absolute return products, ranging from equity long/short funds through to global macro funds, with the intention of capturing<br/>positive returns at a low level of volatility, something that traditional fixed income funds may struggle to achieve going forward.<br/>We are not arguing for a wholesale move away from fixed income strategies (we do hold some esoteric fixed income positions), but the current environment calls for a different, more modern, investment approach. Absolute return products needn’t be scary, indeed they may be exactly what we need to navigate the current investment environment: generating steady cash-plus returns whilst limiting risk.<br/>For more information please regarding GAM’s 5 risk-rated portfolios visit www.gam.com or contact Emma Howard on 020 7393 8834 / emma.howard@gam.com<br/>James McDaid<br/>Investment Manager, GAM<br/>Source: GAM unless otherwise stated.

The global financial crisis has ushered in<br/>a degree of government and Central Bank market intervention that is unprecedented, leading to distortions in asset valuations which will eventually have to be unwound.<br/>This is probably most evident in bond markets. If, after a 33 year secular bull market cycle, developed bond markets have made their secular low points in yields, their role as defensive and diversifying components within portfolios may well be compromised.

The ability to hand-pick individual positions, express relative preferences or to build a bespoke basket of stocks is likely to be increasingly important in the world of modest returns. A focus on asset class behaviours, as opposed to labels, is also, we believe, critical in achieving robust diversification.<br/>We are potentially at a fork in the road, meaning investors and their advisors are left with the choice about what type of multi- asset funds should form the foundations of their portfolios for the future. These, we feel, will have to have demonstrated an ability to pro-actively manage risk and deliver returns at reasonable costs.<br/>","What is income?<br/>Generating an income has been an increasingly important objective for many investors.<br/>The income available from conventional savings accounts has dwindled to near-zero<br/>at a time when changes to the pension rules have set more retirees in search of income- generative investments to replace an annuity income stream. The insurance and asset management industries have responded and advisers now have a wealth of income choices available: How can they navigate these choices for clients?<br/>We believe there is a virtue in simplicity and would argue that diversification within the major asset classes is more than important simply selecting the fund with the broadest spread of assets. Security by security analysis<br/>can ensure diversification across a blend of risk factors, rather than simply the broad macro factors such as interest rates or investor risk appetite that often guide the performance differential between asset classes. In particular, a focus on valuation can ensure that a fund manager avoids the worst excesses of the market and mitigates risk.<br/>We would also argue for the importance of a ‘real yield’ – a yield that is organic rather than generated artificially. At a time when interest rates are at 0.5% and the income available<br/>on cash savings is negligible, an investment paying 7-8% will have associated risks, be<br/>that liquidity, default or business risk. Equally,<br/>a number of equity funds now artificially raise the income by selling call options. This is a valid strategy, but may cap a fund’s capacity for capital growth.<br/>Advisers looking to build a robust and reliable income-generative portfolio for clients have a range of factors to consider, in the blend of assets they use, the risks they are taking and<br/>how those investments are structured. A higher, inflation-adjusted income for clients is possible, but advisers must ensure that it does not come at too high a price.<br/>James Crossley<br/>Retail Distribution Director Jupiter<br/>T: 0203 817 1063<br/>E: Advisersupport@jupiteram.com W: www.jupiteram.com<br/>Important information<br/>This article is for informational purposes only and is not investment advice.

Of course, the traditional annuity is still an option, but it may not necessarily be the most suitable option for everybody, and more investors are expected to consider other income investment options, such as multi- asset income funds.<br/>Three such alternatives that may interest those approaching or in retirement are the Premier Multi-Asset Distribution Fund, Premier<br/>Multi-Asset Monthly Income Fund, and Premier Multi-Asset Growth & Income Fund. The Funds invest in a variety of other funds providing exposure to a range of assets selected by our multi-asset team for their potential to pay<br/>a regular and sustainable income as well as typically being funds managed by specialist investment teams. By diversifying in this way, the multi-asset team aim to manage risk and open up the income opportunities, rather than relying on a single asset to deliver the income. Our funds also produce a “natural” income. This is the income that the investor receives<br/>as dividends, which are aggregated from the dividends of the portfolio’s underlying dividend distributions. So, the income in this case is the number of shares in a fund multiplied by the dividend per share. The income can fluctuate over time but no shares have to be cashed-in, meaning the income investor will have their full pack of shares to get paid dividends for as long as they hold the investment. The income share price will also fluctuate but should have the potential to grow over time.<br/>Paul Pugh<br/>Head of Strategic Partnerships, Premier Asset Management<br/>M: 07799 884 075<br/>E: paulpugh@premierfunds.co.uk<br/>This article is for information purposes and is only to be issued to financial intermediaries.

In contrast to activists who take short positions and exert a destructive downward force, Sherborne-style activism is constructive. It seeks appreciation in its stake and attempts to accomplish this through useful, productive engagement with company leadership.<br/>Sherborne started building its stake when Electra’s shares were trading at a discount of nearly 20% reflecting, in Sherborne’s view, shareholder expectations of underperformance. Electra however was not an outlier in its sector and had respectable share performance.<br/>Electra’s share price rose strongly, largely due – ironically – to Sherborne’s interest in it. When Sherborne held 19% of the company, head Edward Bramson proposed appointing three new board directors, himself included, to lead a strategic review.

In our view, a straightforward, diversified, low cost approach, should serve a variety of investors well.<br/>We like to think of our Vanguard LifeStrategy Funds, for example, as an outwardly simple but inwardly sophisticated solution. There is a significant level of diversification in the funds given their construction with market-cap weighted index funds. If you look at the 60/40 Fund, made up of 60% global equities and 40% global fixed income, it includes 25 asset classes, including emerging markets and small cap equities.<br/>The passive funds also help keep costs<br/>down, which are one of the few levers in<br/>the investor’s control. Given the inverse relationship between costs and returns, lower costs should translate into higher returns over time. Costs are also one of the few things in investor’s control. Of course, we also need to bear in mind that the value of investments can fall as well as rise and investors may not get back all of what they invest.<br/>Perspective on two popular alternative asset classes<br/>In today’s low yield environment, we are often asked about the inclusion of commercial property and other alternative asset classes as a substitute for fixed income. It’s important<br/>to remember that commercial property has much different risk characteristics than bonds and there is no liquid, publicly traded market for this type of asset. Property values are only updated on an annual basis through appraisal, distorting their reported correlations, and experience suggests they will not offer the same levels of diversification during periods of market stress.<br/>Commodities are another ‘alternative’ asset class we are often asked about that also cannot be invested in directly. Exposure is typically obtained through futures markets. They are liquid, publicly traded, but a future does not have a cash flow and can’t be valued in the same way as equities and bonds. Instead, valued are obtained by other facts such as supply and demand and the time to maturity, making<br/>their prices more volatile. Correlations of commodities and traditional asset classes have also risen significantly over time, potentially reducing their diversification benefits.<br/>Finally, our research shows that to make any real difference, investors need to allocate around 10% or more of a given asset class<br/>to their portfolio. This suggests significant commitment and requires you to underweight another asset class.<br/>There are pros and cons to every investment decision, but in our view, a straightforward, well-diversified portfolio of equities and bonds, implemented at a low cost, should work well for a variety of investors.<br/>Asset allocation name<br/>Attitude to Risk<br/>Risk Rating<br/>Vanguard LifeStrategy 40%<br/>Balanced<br/>3.3<br/>Vanguard LifeStrategy 60%<br/>Moderately Adventurous<br/>4.1<br/>Vanguard LifeStrategy 80%<br/>Adventurous<br/>5.1<br/>3.3 4.1 5.1<br/>47<br/>Synaptic Guide to Multi Asset Funds<br/>","48<br/>A new direction for protection<br/>As Royal London, our commitment to traditional values, service and the intermediary market will always endure.<br/>We offer cover where it matters by focusing on conditions people are more likely to get and ensuring we offer some of the best definitions for these.

This was where lenders sold a reasonable (at least in principle) product at grossly inflated prices to countless people who didn’t need the cover or in some cases, weren’t even aware they had it. It took the regulator years to stamp out all the bad practices and, in the meantime, mortgage lenders carried on making almost obscene amounts of money. In some years, some of the big banks even earned more by selling PPI than their total profits for the year.<br/>The second event is more recent, and again it features a key role played by the regulator. After years of painfully slow action (is this<br/>beginning to sound familiar?) the mortgage market had, by 2007, developed poor practices that the regulator had largely turned a blind eye to. One telling statistic was that between 2000 and 2007, the value of new gross mortgage lending had more than trebled<br/>in size. When it did act, through the FSA’s Mortgage Market Review, a more draconian regulatory regime virtually outlawed not just the bad practices but also some of the good, or at least defensible, ones too. The end result has been more paperwork and a slowdown in mortgage lending too.<br/>The fallout from these two events has been twofold. First, sales of PPI – even ‘good’ PPI – have dwindled to a fraction of their previous levels. It is simply now seen as a toxic product. And, no other product has come along to replace it – although good (and in many cases a lot better) products are available too. Second, the MMR has led to a much longer mortgage advice process and that, in turn, has led to many mortgage advisers no longer advising on protection needs. Quite simply, they don’t have the time.<br/>What’s all this got to do with you? Well, regardless of whether you’re a mortgage broker or not, there is now a significant opportunity to target homeowners who have inadequate protection.<br/>There’s a third event just about to hit hard- pressed mortgage borrowers too and that one doesn’t involve the regulator. No, this one involves another Government department<br/>– HM Treasury. From November 2015, the standard rate of Insurance Premium Tax (IPT) went up from 6% to 9.5%. That means that any homebuyers with PPI or an accident, sickness and unemployment (ASU) plan (and be careful, because some of these use the generic term ‘income protection’ when many of us would prefer that phrase was used just for long term or ‘permanent’ products) will see their premiums rise on renewal.<br/>The marketing opportunity for advisers is to find out:<br/>a) Whathomebuyers’protectionneedsare<br/>b) Whatprotectioninsurances(ifany)they<br/>have already and,<br/>c) Whatoptionstheyshouldconsidernow<br/>One way to target such people is through contacts such as mortgage brokers who don’t have time to ‘talk protection’. Many do, and some actively target that, but far too many do not, for reasons that are perhaps understandable.<br/>Whether you’re a mortgage broker or not, there is now a significant opportunity to target homeowners who have inadequate protection.<br/>","51<br/>It’s a growing concern that hundreds of thousands of mortgage borrowers every year don’t have sufficient protection insurance in place if disaster hits.<br/>A second way is through referrals from existing clients. Many of your clients are probably close to or into their retirement years. If so, do they have children, nephews or nieces who have recently taken out a mortgage? Chances are, they’ll happily refer you because they are likely to be far more aware of the risks than the ‘young people’ are.<br/>Third, some areas – new estates, up<br/>and coming areas and anywhere with a preponderance of ‘Sold’ boards, may also yield people who would be only too happy to get some advice about protecting their mortgage. A simple mailshot can work well.<br/>Want another reason to target this market? Well, from 2017, the Government is changing the rules on how it will help people who get into mortgage difficulties. At present, they may qualify for SMI – Support for Mortgage Interest. Under this scheme, if you qualify for Income Support, income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance or Employment and Support Allowance, or Pension Credit, the Government will pay<br/>the mortgage interest up to a pre-set figure (currently 3.12%) on the first £200,000 of mortgage capital (£100,000 if they get Pension Credit). It won’t pay any capital payments and there are various restrictions and rules to be observed (and a 13 week waiting period – 39 weeks from April 2016). The rules are set out at https://www.gov.uk/support-for-mortgage- interest/overview.<br/>From April 2017, support will still be given,<br/>but it will be in the form of a loan – which will have to be paid back eventually. Given that house prices have tended to rise over time, the thinking behind the change is that taxpayers shouldn’t be asked to fund other people’s investments and it saves the Government money too (you decide which of those is the real reason...).<br/>So, for borrowers who have to date simply relied on the Government safety net if things go wrong, now is a very good time for them to think about how they should best protect themselves.<br/>In terms of solutions, this is likely to include looking at:<br/>• Life insurance. Decreasing or level term insurance is usually chosen to at least cover the outstanding mortgage.<br/>• Critical illness insurance, again to at least cover the mortgage.<br/>• Income protection insurance to cover all monthly mortgage costs and enough to live on too.<br/>• As an alternative, ASU can be used, but this has the disadvantages that the maximum benefit period is usually just one or two years and also that premiums attract IPT – at 9.5% from November.<br/>• Unemployment insurance (if they qualify – and the self-employed usually don’t). This can be included in ASU plans and in some long term income protection plans too.<br/>It’s a growing concern that hundreds of thousands of mortgage borrowers every year don’t have sufficient protection insurance in place if disaster hits. As an individual adviser, you can’t cure that, but you can do something that helps your clients and helps you grow an important, profitable and sustainable part of your business too.

Yet, research by LV= shows just 10% of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) have protection, leaving almost 4 million businesses financially vulnerable.<br/>An easy way to position Business Protection with your clients<br/>At LV=, we encourage advisers to think of Business Protection as insurance that safeguards three core business elements:<br/>Ownership - If a partner or shareholder dies (or is diagnosed with a critical illness), the proceeds help<br/>the remaining owners buy the affected business shares. Without protection, the surviving owners could lose control of the business, impacting ongoing success. Business Protection to protect ownership is written as Share or Partnership Protection.<br/>Profit - If a business loses a key person who influences revenue, the policy gives the firm a cash injection,<br/>helping replace lost profits and possibly recruit a replacement. Key Person cover can be used to protect profits.<br/>Debt – Key Person cover can also be<br/>used to clear debt (sometimes called loan protection).Without a cash<br/>injection, investors and creditors (like the bank) may call in debts they think the business can’t pay them off.<br/>Not to be forgotten, Relevant Life Cover is a tax- efficient life insurance policy, allowing SMEs to offer death-in-service benefits to their staff.<br/>Feedback from advisers suggests Business Protection can be more difficult to write compared to personal cover. Larger cases slow down the underwriting process, and trusts can seem complicated.<br/>But, Business Protection is just simply life insurance and critical illness cover, written on the life a business owner, or key employee.<br/>","53<br/>LV= research shows 29% of businesses don’t think they need protection, despite almost a quarter of firms with cover have made a claim.<br/>Build your credibility<br/>Before meeting with clients, it’s important<br/>to understand the different legal business structures, as this will influence how you write the cover. Having a basic understanding of your client’s business will also demonstrate your credibility and give your advice further kudos.<br/>Sole traders (or the self-employed)<br/>This is the simplest type of business, which<br/>is owned and controlled by one person (who might have staff). If your client’s business is new, they’re likely to be a sole trader as most firms start-up in this way. The sole trader is personally responsible for all debts – if they die, this is inherited by their family. Key Person cover should be used to protect profits and pay off loans.<br/>Some advisers struggle to find Business Protection clients, but with more than 4.6 million self-employed people in the UK, it’s extremely likely you have a lucrative back book.<br/>Traditional or ordinary partnerships<br/>This is a business owned by one or more partners, working together with a view to make a profit. Like sole traders, the partners are personally liable for all business debt, so Key Person cover should be considered.<br/>Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs)<br/>Unlike sole traders and partnerships, the owners are only responsible for the amount of money they’ve invested into the business. LLPs can own property, like an insurance policy, and Key Person cover can be used to protect profits or pay off debt. Partnership Protection can also safeguard ownership.<br/>Limited companies<br/>These are companies owned by shareholders and run by directors. Key Person cover can sustain profits or clear debt, and Share Protection can protect ownership.<br/>Taking the hard work out of Business Protection<br/>We know even the most experienced adviser has questions from time to time, so have invested in comprehensive Business Protection training for all our service teams.

Published findings from research undertaken by Drewberry show that just 7% of the UK population protects their income – this compares with the 25% that have pet insurance. Advisers need to be aware that, without advice, for many consumers the wellbeing of their animals, as opposed to themselves, is more important!<br/>There seems to be a general lack of awareness about the level of support provided by the state with many overestimating the amount of help they will receive.<br/>Counter the “I don’t need this” argument<br/>Research conducted by YouGov on behalf of Cirencester Friendly revealed some worrying statistics about how financially unprepared a significant section of the UK population is for a long term absence from work due to ill-health.<br/>When asked where they would turn for help<br/>if they had to stop working due to sickness, 53% of those surveyed said that they would depend on the state to support them. 41% said that they would last less than three months before running into serious difficulties<br/>such as an inability to pay the mortgage, rent and utility bills.<br/>There seems to be a general lack of awareness about the level of support provided by the state with many overestimating the amount of help they will receive. The reality is that<br/>benefits will simply not cover the outgoings of the vast majority of workers.<br/>Although individual situations will vary depending on the employer, the minimum that a worker who is off sick for four or more days in a row is entitled to is £88.45<br/>","55<br/>Statistics from the Department of Work and Pensions show that over 2.5 million people have been unable to work for three months or more and are currently claiming illness-related benefits.<br/>per week. Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) is paid by the employer for 28 weeks before the claimant then has to make an application to the government for Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). The assessment rate (£57.90 for under 25s and £73.10 for over 25s) is paid for the first 13 weeks and following a successful application either £102.15 or £109.30 (depending<br/>on circumstances and national insurance contributions) from then on.<br/>Statistics from the Department of Work and Pensions show that over 2.5 million people have been unable to work for three months or more and are currently claiming illness- related benefits. The odds of falling ill or suffering an accident that compromises the ability to work are relatively low. However, such misfortune cannot be predicted.<br/>For example, in 2014, 27% of the 720 claims paid by Cirencester Friendly were for accidents or injury. This is consistently the most common reason cited in claims submitted to Cirencester Friendly.<br/>These findings should serve as a strong reminder to both consumers and the adviser community. Clearly explaining to clients that they are potentially playing Russian Roulette with their finances if they do not take up some kind of protection product should help convince those who come to you with the “it<br/>won´t happen to me so I don´t need this” attitude.<br/>Use claims statistics<br/>Unfortunately, the fear of claims being declined affects the entire insurance sector. For protection providers, this is where the publication of claims statistics comes in<br/>and a more transparent approach to claims payment has certainly helped to address some of the concerns held by intermediaries and consumers.<br/>The publication of claims statistics builds<br/>up a bank of data in the public domain that sets a standard by which each provider will be judged. In 2014, we paid 94% of claims and the figures published by other providers were broadly similar. If one provider´s claims statistics were significantly lower than its competitors then that should naturally prompt some adjustments in order to meet the expectations of its clients.<br/>Know the products<br/>Some believe that protection is not as important as pensions or mortgages but<br/>this is a flawed point of view. After all, if the worst did happen and someone was left with no income due to ill health, how would they save for retirement or pay the mortgage? Advisers should also consider the impact on<br/>their own business should clients be unable to continue contributing towards their pensions or savings plans.<br/>A good protection contract should be designed to help the client when they need it most. The feedback we have received from Cirencester Friendly Members is that, much like a life-jacket or a fire-extinguisher, they don’t realise the value of their contract until they have to use it.<br/>1 YouGov PLC Income Protection (November 2014)<br/>ii YouGov PLC Income Protection (November 2014)<br/>iii Statutory Sick Pay (SSP): https://www.gov.uk/statutory-sick-pay/ what-youll-get (July 2015)<br/>iv Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) https://www.gov.uk/ employment-support-allowance/what-youll-get (July 2015)<br/>v EmploymentandSupportAllowance(ESA)https://www.gov.uk/ employment-support-allowance/what-youll-get (July 2015)<br/>vi Office of National Statiscis – BEN01: Main out of work benefits (13 May 2015)<br/>vii Cirencester Friendly Claims Statistic Card (January 2015)<br/>","56<br/>Synaptic Webline is the Robo Protector<br/>Eric Armstrong | Product Marketing | Synaptic Software Limited<br/>One of the biggest discussions in the industry today is the role of<br/>Robo advice. The regulator has come out in support of ‘innovation’ by offering a low touch regulation ‘sand pit’ for new entrants looking to experiment with providing automated advice for consumers under a lighter regulation regime – and Providers and Fund Management firms are licking their chops at the prospect of having automated distribution options for everything from fact finds and risk profiling to portfolio management. It’s a big deal politically, from a regulatory perspective and of course commercially.<br/>Having discussed this with other industry participants, we think that the evolution<br/>will follow a known trajectory, and the most successful practitioners will be those that combine robo processes with intelligent human invention. In the investment world the fruits of Robo will start to make a difference in a few years’ time, if people start to recognise the ability of an automated process to tailor investment solutions to their own circumstances.<br/>This winning combination of man and machine already exists in the Protection world, where consumers are absolutely used to seeking cover online. Received wisdom says<br/>that Protection is sold, not bought, but that view is contradicted by the emerging facts: Google searches are increasing by over 80% year on year and the majority of Protection business is now sourced online. The large websites that offer Protection are seeing their traffic increase exponentially. Overall Protection sales are falling (source ABI), because brokers and advisers are losing touch with their calling in this area. But what is now driving Protection sales are the big Protection web based Protection sellers, and the most successful of these are built around the Synaptic Synaptic Webline portal, accessing quotes in real time via simple integrations with Synaptic Synaptic Webline web services.<br/>The business model is simple and elegant. Customer acquisition is facilitated online by applicants who identify themselves, with the option of completing an application online without human intervention. The ones that<br/>do not complete, for whatever reason, can then be contacted by humans, who can tell what kind of prospect they are from their interaction with the Synaptic Webline Robo process – meaning that the skilful advisers have a large pool of pre-qualified leads to work with – and many of these companies are enjoying enormous and growing success. The perfect Cyborgian symbiosis of man and machine creating valuable social benefit of Protection cover for families across the nation.<br/>","57<br/>In the investment world the fruits of Robo will start to make a difference in a few years’ time, if people start to recognise the ability of an automated process to tailor investment solutions to their own circumstances.<br/>The pioneers in this area did not have a blue print to work from and were taking risks<br/>to build new business models, armed only with their faith in the increasing role of the internet in our lives. Companies setting up businesses on this model do have a blue print for success that will allow them to create new enterprises or leverage their existing brands.<br/>One attractive element of building a technical front end of this nature, is that it can be done relatively cheaply and can be very cheap to run. We will even do a deal where the already low ongoing costs of running the service are reduced if a certain number of applications are generated monthly – and this number is probably lower than you think. The flexibility of the technology means that every element of the journey is configurable by the website owner, including back office functionality, access to quote and electronic application<br/>for agents, commission sacrifice or panel management.<br/>The successful incumbents who are already working in this way mostly began as start-ups or small businesses. Synaptic Webline itself was created by an IFA who was fed up of ringing up and faxing for quotes for Protection business – and is now generating over 6 million quotes a month, and responsible for nearly a quarter of the UK’s term business.<br/>Our contention is that Protection can be a significant profit centre in any business that sells mortgages or offers any kind of investment or holistic advice. It is unclear to us why so many companies shun the commercial opportunities offered by Protection, especially when it represents a secondary stream of income to their main business, and therefore contributing significantly to the bottom line.<br/>Unlike the investment world where advisers are now obliged to deduct their remuneration from their clients’ platform based portfolios, and not as commission from Providers<br/>– the icing on this particular cake is the commission that Providers will pay for the distribution of their products. This is clearly an arrangement where commission is being used responsibly to provide valuable and cost effective solutions for consumers, providing sustainability for advisory businesses, delivered in the consumers’ preferred format.
