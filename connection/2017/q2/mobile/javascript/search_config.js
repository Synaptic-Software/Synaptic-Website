Judging by several current headlines, e.g. ‘Fears grow over advisers’ investment due diligence’ (Money Marketing 27.04.17), you’d think some parts of the industry were only just switching on to the value of good (Synaptic) research.<br/>This seems so simple, but perhaps it’s not. We are aware of heavily marketed tools used by advisers where the charging data<br/>is frequently incorrect, but use of the outcomes from the research which are routinely wrong are considered acceptable. Sometimes it feels like our industry is performing in an examination where getting the answers wrong doesn’t matter.<br/>In regards to research and risk, I went to<br/>a large industry event recently where the director of a well know research house was presenting, explaining that the role of an investment committee was ‘to take a view’ on the likely growth of different asset classes in order to effectively set asset allocations for different risk categories. We all know of course that this is not how it works. Research analysis of successful investment strategies teaches us to avoid undue speculation, including the kind that make ‘calls’ on major trend inflection points.<br/>A good story is not the same as good research – which must inform the full range of viable outcomes.<br/>Good research builds in contingencies, monitors progress, allows adjustments to be made where necessary and sets the tolerances for ongoing losses at sustainable levels to allow long term benefits to accrue.<br/>At Synaptic we have been thinking about the importance of good research in the context<br/>of our new retirement income modelling<br/>and drawdown illustration tool (currently undergoing testing and available Q3 ’17). Retirement planning is such an important area to get right, so there is no room for sloppiness that could undermine the best possible advice and outcomes for customers due to poor data, poor methodology or poor replicability.<br/>We are delighted also to be announcing<br/>the arrival of the Synaptic Risk Ratings into Synaptic Product and Fund, so all advisers can benefit from the Synaptic risk metrics when dealing with ‘Capacity for Loss’.

According to a National Audit Office report in November, one-third of the UK’s HNWs are currently subject to an HMRC inquiry into their tax affairs. Worryingly for advisers, HMRC has floated proposals to sanction those who market schemes.<br/>Will these moves make the HNW segment less attractive to financial advisers?<br/>Leveraging existing HNW clients<br/>HNW clients are prized by financial advisers the world over and the increased scrutiny<br/>is unlikely to change this. In fact, the desire to attract HNW individuals has never<br/>been stronger given their rising numbers and growing needs. In the light of the tax clampdown, advisers will consider how they provide services, but they are unlikely to withdraw services altogether.<br/>Why are HNWs so prized? Well, not only<br/>do they have sizeable pools of money to manage, but they represent a marketing tool that enables advisers to gain access to other HNWs and further pools of money.<br/>In addition, while HNW clients may materialise after the sale of a business or other windfall, further transactions often follow over the years. This puts the adviser in pole position to help the client manage subsequent transactions and the cashflows from them.<br/>Show your competence<br/>Some advisers have no HNW clients. Given the networking potential from leveraging a single such client, making considerable efforts to capture one seems a reasonable business proposition.<br/>It pays to consider their real needs, rather than perceived needs. They may at some stage want access to exotic investments, but this is unlikely to be an immediate priority. In fact, any kind of investment pitch as an opening gambit is probably unwise: if all you do is manage a client’s money, your<br/>Any kind of investment pitch as an opening gambit is probably unwise: if all you do is manage a client’s money, your relationship with them is likely to ebb and flow with the markets.<br/>","5<br/>It is essential to have a professional team in place and a clear plan to attract HNWs. If you look at your competitors and think they got lucky, that they were there at the right time and in the right place, you have probably drawn the wrong conclusion.<br/>relationship with them is likely to ebb and flow with the markets.<br/>In our opinion, a successful, longer-term wealth management relationship is underpinned by more fundamental needs. Many HNWs are juggling many financial and non-financial issues. Some are utterly unprepared for any potential hiccup in their lives. So the starting place is the will, insurance, strategic financial planning, tax, pension vehicles and, only after that, investment strategies.<br/>If HNWs can clearly see they will feel more comfortable as a result, trust starts to develop.<br/>How to provide a complete service<br/>Of course, there is little point in offering to organise the lives of HNWs if you are not set up to fulfil the task.<br/>Some advisers have created teams of professionals to help entrepreneur clients in particular. This may involve partnering with a business valuation specialist, a corporate financier, a private banker and lawyers.<br/>The business valuation team allows the entrepreneur to value the business away from the scrutiny of the marketplace and fix any shortcomings to increase the value of the business before a sale. The corporate finance<br/>team assists potential buyers by providing financing and moving the deal along at the right speed. Overseeing the transaction are the lawyers who are familiar with the whole team. The proceeds of sale are managed by the adviser, possibly partnering with an asset manager such as Russell Investments, who can advise on short and longer-term needs.<br/>Unearthing prospects<br/>Putting all this into practice requires identifying clients who require complete wealth management.<br/>Sometimes, of course, a client channel will develop from an existing client or clients. When developing new channels, it makes sense to assess which industries are growing or have undergone strong growth.<br/>The HNW is different from the mass affluent channel in that it is insufficient to be friendly and honest. While these qualities help, more important for HNWs is useful information delivered clearly, in a timely manner and allied to practical assistance.<br/>Take dentistry, which has become a growth industry in the UK as middle class wealth has increased and as more people are unable to access NHS dentistry. Dentists are entrepreneurs and have business needs,<br/>including insurance, benefits and pension needs for staff, retirement planning, tax filing and succession planning.<br/>Private dentists tend to wear a lot of hats and need help juggling key tasks. Advisers can win their trust by creating services to meet some or all of these needs and making the entrepreneurial dentist’s life easier.<br/>Conclusion – make a plan, and use it<br/>In short, to succeed in this space, it is essential to have a professional team in place and a clear plan to attract HNWs. If you look at your competitors and think they got lucky, that they were there at the right time and<br/>in the right place, you have probably drawn the wrong conclusion. Most have made considerable effort to understand client’s real needs and serve them better as a result.<br/>www.helpingadvisers.co.uk For financial advisers only.<br/>This document is issued by Russell Investments Limited, a company incorporated in England and Wales under registered number 02086230 and with its registered office at: Rex House, 10 Regent Street, London SW1Y 4PE.

This ever more urgent hunt for yield might be leading them into assets with characteristics they may not necessarily understand and, as a result, they might be exposing themselves to higher levels of risk.<br/>Despite these risks, Flood believes that the current climate presents investors with strong opportunities via multi-asset investing. He thinks multi-asset investing is as much about the assets investors do not own, as it is about those they do own, which can display attractive qualities. Key to investment success in the current climate will be the ability to access assets that can offer some degree of inflation proofing.<br/>Flood thinks this is not always possible when investing in mainstream equities and bonds, nor indeed when one diversifies into less mainstream areas such as high yield bonds. Historically, Flood notes that equities have provided inflation protection over the long<br/>1 https://www.ft.com/content/a0c3fce4-d0e2-11e6-b06b-680c49b4b4c0 2 Jan 2017<br/>3 https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/03/bank-of-england-rate-cuts-2017-growth-forecast-inflation 3 Nov 2016 4 Bloomberg figures as at 28 February 2017<br/>term, but he believes this is not guaranteed, and in the current climate where UK 10-year government bonds are yielding 1.1%4, fixed- income investors may not be compensated for the corrosive effects of inflation. Within high yield bonds, the extra yield paid to investors to compensate them for the higher risk of owning the debt of a less secure company, known as the spread, has compressed to such an extent that investors will have to be highly selective in this asset class if they are to avoid significant losses.<br/>Fiscal policy on the agenda<br/>Flood sees fiscal policy as firmly back on the agenda as the UK transitions away from a deflationary environment. This, he notes, is encouraging investment managers to spend more time identifying inflation-linked assets and to prioritise the ‘inflation proofing’ of their clients’ portfolios as best they can.<br/>So what are the inflation-proofing options available for investors? Newton advocates a multi-asset approach based on rigorous stock<br/>As the UK prepares to leave the European Union, a post-Brexit weakening of the pound is just one development sparking investor concerns about rising inflationary pressures1.<br/>The headline rate of inflation measured by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) is expected to rise to about 3% from a current rate of 1.8% this year, and the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has also warned that rising inflation will hit British households2.<br/>The Bank of England has separately forecast that inflation will accelerate above its 2% target in 2017 and 2018 before falling back in 20203, increasing the chances of an interest rate hike within the next few months.<br/>Increasing risk<br/>According to Paul Flood, lead manager of Newton’s Multi-Asset Income Fund, a fund that aims to deliver a sustainable monthly income, both inflationary concerns and the current low- return environment have encouraged many<br/>2 https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/07/food-inflation-doubles-uk-shoppers-feel-pinch 7 March 2017<br/>","7<br/>Unlike cash and most conventional bonds, assets with inflation-linked contracts can be attractive for long-term savers because their investments have a degree of inflation protection built in.<br/>selection and suggests that within a multi-asset portfolio, exposure to assets such as renewable energy and infrastructure, which have very little sensitivity to the economic cycle, can afford a degree of inflation protection to investors.<br/>According to Flood, another potential benefit of multi-asset investing is the ability to allow wide diversification, which helps to balance risk and return across a range of assets over time.<br/>Inflation protection<br/>Flood believes that for those looking to save, and especially for those looking to save over the longer term, protecting assets against the potential ravages of inflation is paramount. Unlike cash and most conventional bonds, assets with inflation-linked contracts can<br/>be attractive for long-term savers because their investments have a degree of inflation protection built in.<br/>However, Flood cautions that the sheer range of multi-asset investments on offer ultimately calls for a cautious approach to asset allocation and, where necessary, expert advice. He believes investors need to be careful how they allocate their investments and to try to avoid exposure to overvalued assets, or those with overlapping exposure.<br/>The Newton Multi-Asset Income Fund aims to do exactly that. Newton’s long-term global thematic approach to investment adds rigour to the investment process and lends itself<br/>to the identification of valuation anomalies<br/>in global markets. Having a single portfolio management approach, where the portfolios are directly invested rather than being funds of funds, gives the fund manager full flexibility atboththeassetallocationandsecurity selection level. This allows Flood to focus on specific securities where he believes valuations and income-generating potential are most attractive.<br/>For the increasing number of investors looking to protect themselves from the rising inflation threat, while at the same time seeking to generate a sustainable income, an unconstrained multi-asset approach with the flexibility to access the most attractively valued opportunities is worthy of serious consideration.<br/>For more information, please contact BNY Mellon:<br/>www.bnymellonim.com<br/>+44 (0) 207 163 8888 salessupport@bnymellon.com<br/>IMPORTANT INFORMATION<br/>Past performance is not a guide to future performance.

It’s nice to have the chance to write for<br/>people, but you have to be a bit careful. Plagiarism is not cool, kids,<br/>even of yourself.<br/>Anyway, what I found was that the platform sector was in a bit of a lull. Everyone was mucking around with boring old legislation and regulation, and nothing much was happening. Oh, there was going to be a referendum, but everyone knew how that was going to turn out and it was all going to be fine.<br/>Spool forward a year and things couldn’t<br/>be more different. We’ve got M&A activity. We’ve got an explosion in bespoke deals. We’ve got digital advice and investing services mixing things up a bit. We’ve had a rash of pricing changes. And we’ve got an FCA probe into platforms and their wily ways coming up.<br/>This last is really interesting, and judging by the rictus-like grins on the faces of many providers, that’s ‘interesting’ in the sense of ‘please, make it stop, it burns, IT BURNS, IT HURTS SO MUCH.’<br/>We wrote two years ago that ‘platforms are dead’. And yes, we were trolling, but only<br/>a little bit. A troll-ette, you might say. In fact, much of what we wrote about at that time still resonates now, and has an echo in what we know so far will be in scope for the platform market review.<br/>We felt that platforms as a sector had become moribund and had failed to live up to their promise. They had disrupted the industry, that’s true, but were more than overdue<br/>being disrupted in their turn. In their desire to capture the middle ground, they had begun to look more and more alike. Functionality had converged, with a massive arms race resulting in a surfeit of bloated, borderline unusable systems. There was little if anything in there for clients – reporting in particular sucked so hard that it, in fact, blew.<br/>Few providers were willing to stand out in terms of pricing – and those that did,<br/>especially at the sharper end, were the recipients of snarky nonsense from others about deep pockets and sustainability and why it was good for clients to pay twice as much for exactly the same thing. And all were silent on perhaps the biggest failing<br/>of all – why a sector which was designed<br/>to let investors access ‘institutional’ style share classes of funds continued to pile investors’ money into schmucky retail classes, superclean or otherwise.<br/>We also found (and have continued to find<br/>in further research waves) that many adviser platform-enabled propositions are seriously expensive, weighing in at over 2%. Vertically integrated propositions are often worse than that. In a lower-for-longer return environment, for us that’s just too much.<br/>To us, this was a full-blown existential identity crisis for the sector in which we made our coin, and which we really wanted to be vibrant<br/>","9<br/>Either the platform industry can get its house in order or the twin pressures of disruptors and regulators will save it the bother.<br/>and exciting for years to come. So we wrote what we wrote, and dealt with the inevitable deluge of narky calls and emails about how XYZ platform wasn’t dead at all, thank you very much, just look at its rosy cheeks and so on and so on.<br/>And – predictably – not much happened. The Earth rotated on its axis. We all got a bit older. Everyone got on with whatever they were doing before. I perfected a tortilla recipe with chorizo I’ve been trying to get right for a while, and worked out the chords to ‘Shipwreckers’ by James Yorkston (who gave the lang cat its name).<br/>And now we have the platform market review. Its thrust? To find out if platforms – across direct and advised – are offering value for investors (not advisers) and if the market<br/>is working in an orderly fashion. Along the way it may ask such questions as ‘Why Use A Platform If You’re Just Holding A Multi- Asset Fund?’ and ‘How Come You All Charge The Same, Except The Fixed Fee One?’ and ‘Why Aren’t Funds Quite A Lot Cheaper On Platforms If You’re Doing All The Aggregating Of The Trading And That?’. These are good questions and ones which need answering.<br/>You can expect a bit of disruption as a result of the review. That’s a good thing, if potentially administratively inconvenient. But the herding<br/>we’ve seen in terms of functionality, service and price; the cosy cabal which has seen pricing revert to the mean of 30-35bps across nearly all the market in the last six months is ripe for a shake-up, and that will be to your clients’ benefit. Note I say ‘your clients’ – these are the people who pay for platforms, and who need to derive much more benefit from then than they do currently.<br/>Incidentally, I always like to put a wee plug for our hosts in, and this is as good a point as any – although I don’t know why, it’s not like they pay me to write this stuff. But if you’re looking for a whizzy tool to do lots of comparison stuff in light of disruption and that, Synaptic has one. There. Done.<br/>In closing, I’d like to offer up a trend we see increasing considerably over time. We did a wee paper recently with a nice bunch of folks called SEI, who are the technological power behind such fun-loving cats as True Potential, Best Practice’s Fusion Wealth platform and Tilney. The paper was called ‘Level Up’ and you can download it free from SEI’s website.<br/>Its thrust was that for firms who are growing very fast or who are at scale already (we can fight about what that means, but let’s go for £500m AUA or more at the moment), retail, ‘nilla advised platforms are not necessarily offering enough control and customisation.<br/>If you want the platform you use to look<br/>like you and no-one else, from investment proposition to admin flow to risk management and middle office reconciliations, then you need to start to look a bit wider.<br/>There is a growing market (which of course SEI is part of, as are Pershing, IFDL and others) of firms who are providing a sort of enterprise version of platform architecture for firms who want it the way they want it and no other way. This comes with costs and responsibilities and risks, of course, but as advisers firms grow, acquire others or are acquired themselves, that £500m AUA point doesn’t seem so far away in many cases.<br/>There are lots of reasons to go down this<br/>road – and some not to – but the key thing for our purposes is that this approach, used right, allows you to reinvent the platform industry as you want it to be rather than as it is. And that includes fundamental changes in how you use asset management.<br/>So it’s all going on. Either the platform industry can get its house in order or the twin pressures of disruptors and regulators will save it the bother.<br/>Visit www.langcatfinancial.co.uk for more from Mark and the rest of the lang cats.<br/>","10<br/>Myth-busting the active versus passive debate<br/>Justin Onuekwusi CFA | Fund Manager | Legal & General Investment Management<br/>There are many things in life where you’re going to be asked to pick a side. Who are you supporting in the rugby this weekend? Pepsi Max or Diet Coke? Can I still support the UK in Eurovision this year despite Article 50? When it comes to the active versus passive investment debate, it can feel like there are a lot of assumptions being made which support one side over the other and at times, not a lot of evidence to back these up.<br/>We intend to ‘bust’ some of these myths and provide some much needed clarity into the conversation. Instead of picking a side, we’ll aim to identify the specific benefits of each style and what investors should be on the lookout for.<br/>Myth 1: You get what you pay for<br/>‘Star fund managers’ is still a phrase that you hear quite often from within the investment management industry and sometimes even from particularly keen end-clients. The portfolio managers who consistently manage to deliver sector or market-beating returns and therefore command above-average annual fees in return for their virtuosity. We all know that even slightly higher fees can dramatically erode long-term returns but if my guy’s a market- beating genius, surely I end up better off, right?<br/>There are actually two distinct problems with this assumption. The first is the idea that without the benefit of hindsight, an investor can identify these geniuses of the future (a<br/>process which requires extensive, expensive and skilled manager research resources which many find it difficult to deliver upon); and secondly, the sheer level of outperformance required to overcome the compounding<br/>effect of those higher fees. For all the work that goes into trying to solve the first problem, it is actually the latter which we would argue is the most important.<br/>IA Flexbile Investment, 10 year track record higher 10<br/>IA Mixed Investment 40-85,10 year track record higher 10<br/>return<br/>9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1<br/>return 9<br/>lower return 0<br/>8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1<br/>lower return<br/>Figure 1: Active manager performance by fee decile<br/>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10<br/>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10<br/>lower fee Fee Decile<br/>IA Mixed Investment 20-60, 10 year track record<br/>higher 10<br/>higher fee<br/>Fee Decile<br/>IA Mixed Investment 0-35, 10 year track record<br/>9 88 77 66 55 44 33 22<br/>11<br/>lower return<br/>lower fee<br/>higher fee<br/>return<br/>lower return<br/>higher 10 return 9<br/>lower fee<br/>Fee Decile higher fee<br/>lower fee<br/>Fee Decile higher fee<br/>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10<br/>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10<br/>Performance Decile Performance Decile<br/>Performance Decile Performance Decile<br/>","11<br/>Investors should always ensure that they are aware of the changing conditions which might affect their potential returns.<br/>Figure 2: Percent of Institutional Fixed Income Managers Outperforming the Benchmark<br/>Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC, eVestment Alliance, CRSP. Data as of Dec. 31, 2015. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Chart is provided for illustrative purposes.<br/>If we take a look at the mixed investment landscape over a period of ten years and<br/>split the funds on the basis their fees (see Figure 1), those who command the highest in annual management charges are amongst the worst performing. In charging above-average fees, these fund managers are setting the performance bar so high for themselves that they are almost guaranteed to underperform the average manager in the sector. Although we are not looking specifically at fund managers looking to outperform a benchmark here, it is clear that investors will fare far better over the longer term by investing in managers who charge comparatively less each year. Passive multi-asset managers are not immune to this dynamic either; however, given their generally low annual fees they do start in a stronger position.<br/>Myth busted: It’s not that lower-cost funds are always going to outperform but when the bar’s lower, you’re more likely to clear it.<br/>Myth 2: Index is the best for everything!<br/>There are some weird and wonderful indices out there. For those who want to beat<br/>the peat there’s a Whiskey & Spirits Index (WSKY). If you feel like betting that the Vegas house will win, there’s the Dow Jones US Gambling Index. And for the health-conscious, there’s even a Solactive Obesity Index (and an ETF tracker with the rather tongue-in-cheek ticker SLIM). For those investors who swear<br/>by passive funds and passive funds alone, it can seem like they are all that’s required in constructing a well-diversified portfolio. Low cost, low maintenance, no hassle, right?<br/>However, there are many asset classes where active management is the better choice<br/>for most investors. In the fixed interest space, it might surprise many to learn that active managers thrive in a number of these sub-asset classes (see Figure 2). In global high yield debt, active managers stormed ahead of their comparative index with 85% of them delivering outperformance (alpha). In investment grade, 70% of managers<br/>were able to achieve alpha over and above their passive counterparts. Where market ingredients (liquidity, market capitalisation, cost efficiency, benchmark construction) aren’t optimum, active managers are often better placed to take advantage of these inefficiencies.<br/>Myth busted: In some instances, circumstances favour active management over passive. Investors should always ensure that they are aware of the changing conditions which might affect their potential returns.<br/>For further information:<br/>Call: 0345 070 8684* Email: fundsales@lgim.com Visit: lgim.com<br/>Important Notice<br/>This is not a consumer advertisement.

Economic reform is central to his popular appeal and the market itself has taken a shine to the prospect of an end to ear-popping asset inflation, bottom hugging interest rates and yawning chasms of inequality.<br/>Would it be such a bad thing for the world<br/>if America became great again? The trick is going to be managing this without triggering civil war, exploding the debt mountain(s) or grinding world trade to a halt. Luckily we have a Congress positioned to prevent the more outlandish errors and we wish the ‘Great Man’ well. Fingers crossed.<br/>Views on the impact of Trumponomics fall into three camps: the Good, the Bad and the Ugly.<br/>The Good<br/>Trump promises a regulation bonfire and firehose of infrastructure spending with tax breaks for companies onshoring jobs to the USA. A ‘yuge’ stimulus programme that has sent energy, banking and industrial stocks higher even before it starts. His economic advisory team includes Peter Thiel and<br/>Elon Musk and even the liberals running tech stocks are salivating at the prospect of overseas cash piles repatriating tax free.<br/>According to Goldman Sachs, $150 billion<br/>of the $780 billion anticipated S&P 500 buy-backs in 2017 will be driven by overseas cash coming home, liberated at last from repatriation tax. S&P 500 firms are expected to repatriate around $300 billion of their<br/>$1 trillion total overseas cash this year. This estimate is based on historical precedent. Following the Homeland Investment Act (HIA), US firms repatriated around 30% of their total overseas cash in 2004.<br/>If a tax reform package with the simple goal of boosting domestic investment is passed in 2017, it could feature restrictions on cash usage, so capital spending and cash M&A may experience major boosts. This would be bullish for US equities and may even allow earnings to play catch up with slightly stretched valuations.<br/>An investment and buy-back bonanza beckons and growth expectations are rising in tandem across sectors. If the US is kick-started strongly enough, it may even drag the rest of the world up with it, especially those countries that still manage to run a current account surplus with the US. As for protectionism, The Donald is simply righting imbalances skewed unfairly against the US and enshrined in incompetent treaties, so the reshaped world will have more free-trade, not less.<br/>","13<br/>If the US is kick-started strongly enough, it may even drag the rest of the world up with it, especially those countries that still manage to run a current account surplus with the US.<br/>The Bad<br/>Not everybody takes such a rosy view. Trump’s protectionist ideas and anti-free trade rhetoric fly in the face of traditional Republican ideology, not to mention Classical Economics. In the unlikely event Trump manages, despite the opposition of Congress and his own Trade Secretary, to fully implement his protectionist agenda, the conventional view is that we would see a trade slump. And if the Fed makes a policy mistake as well, hiking too soon, too much or maybe too late, there could be a perfect storm.<br/>Since taking office in early January, Trump<br/>has moved swiftly and published four controversial executive orders targeting immigration, NAFTA, the Wall and the Trans- Pacific Partnership. As Washington becomes more inward looking, we might see a changing of the guard in many regions, leading to greater political unrest and weaker economic outcomes. Trading barriers, tariffs and trade wars generally result in ‘lose-lose’ outcomes for all parties. Against this, Trump’s team are very aware of the Great Depression and its roots in the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act’s trade slump and it looks as if he is paying attention to what his senior appointments<br/>are saying. In any case, Congress will block anything too unconventional.<br/>The Ugly<br/>Trump’s many critics claim he is an erratic, inconsistent, ignorant redneck bully who does not tolerate differences. And that is<br/>just for starters! They see him as completely unsuited to any level of political command,<br/>a crazy maverick who will wreck everything. The market does not mind if his decisions are morally right or wrong, but it does demand clarity. If the crazy version of Trump emerges as the real thing, then we are in trouble. Not least, Mr Trump has a love affair with debt and is not afraid of using bankruptcy to deal with it.<br/>Trump’s own account of himself, for example in ‘The Art of the Deal’, is of a fluid, opportunist and very active businessman, a dealmaker used to hiring and firing and appointing good teams. What has wrong-footed observers is that he is not seeking political or any other form of approval, but is very goal oriented. Taking him at his word, his aim is to restore US hegemony. His detractors argue he has<br/>a vast array of sinister personality disorders. It remains to be seen whether he tackles the Washington and other Swamps or creates new ones.

In what remain volatile, low growth markets he provides<br/>an insight into his Value team’s current thinking, including some of the key investment themes running through the portfolio that contributed to excellent performance in 2016 and that he believes could be key throughout 2017.<br/>In managing equities within the Value portfolios that Alastair runs, he and his team have followed the same value/contrarian investment approach for over 14 years. They seek out companies with low share prices, but which have characteristics that suggest they will recover. These companies’ underperformance could be due to poor management, over expansion, excessive competition or economic weakness. Alastair’s skill as the portfolio manager is to seek those companies which will turnaround their fortunes and avoid those that will not. He then blends these equities with other assets with the aim of reducing the impact of the volatility inherent in equities and<br/>to protect the Fund and investors against unforeseen risks.<br/>Following a number of years where investors had favoured other areas of the market, Alastair’s value/contrarian investment style had an excellent 2016 – in a year which<br/>was characterised by some of the most significant political events in decades and, as a result, market uncertainty. Here we provide some insight into several key investment themes that are currently running through perhaps Alastair’s best-known fund, the Investec Cautious Managed Fund and that Alastair believes could have an impact on<br/>the value/contrarian investing capability throughout 2017.<br/>Theme 1: Central bank credibility is under threat<br/>As existing policies lose their effectiveness, central banks are struggling to generate growth.

A shift of perspective to ‘beyond retirement’ has increased the requirement for advice for retirees. This important shift is reinforced by the demographic mega-trend of large numbers of baby boomers arriving at retirement.<br/>The favourable conditions that have followed this happy cohort through life (free education, cheap housing, secure jobs with good wages and pension entitlement) make for a lively at and post retirement market, and advisers will reap the benefits of servicing these customers for the next few years.<br/>Two things. Firstly advisers must ensure that they are up-skilled to deal with advice in this area – the regulator has announced some concern about ‘competency’. Secondly equip themselves with the resources and tools to provide quality retirement advice: -<br/>• strategies for providing income vary and need to be understood;<br/>• management of risk is much more challenging due to implications around sequence loss, shift in risk tolerances, so a different approach must be assumed;<br/>• maximum withdrawal rates need to be studied and research by luminaries such as Bergen, Kitces, Okusanya should be explored. These point to short-comings in some of the conventional wisdom shared by advisers,<br/>as well as describe some less-well-known strategies that could help your customers.<br/>In response to the new market dynamics, and to specific requests from customers, we are proud to release a new tool for advisers to assist them in advising clients in respect to retirement.<br/>The new tool is designed to illustrate<br/>the impact of choices around retirement income, including drawdown.

It is based on my experience of supporting some 100 firms who sought ideas, input and challenge to their current processes.<br/>The articles will look at:<br/>1. The importance of having an Investment Philosophy and Process, and highlight some challenges around asset allocation.<br/>2. The documentation and processes needed – terms of reference, segmentation, investment committee, etc.<br/>3. Bringing the strands together and looking at due diligence, screening, short lists, and risk management.<br/>The foundations<br/>The FCA referred to CIPs in the finalised guidance issued in July 2012 “Assessing suitability – replacement business and centralised investment propositions”. It<br/>is still an excellent start point for those looking to create a CIP and provides some excellent good and poor practice examples to draw from.<br/>Another key step is to think about the audience that the CIP is aimed at – many firms I have worked with end up with two versions:<br/>a) an internal document or set of processes that is used by the firm to ensure it is delivering consistent good outcomes and b) a simple client facing document that can be used to show the value of the process to<br/>customers (too many firms have excellent investment propositions but fail to articulate the value to customers).<br/>Thinking about the firm and its background, the intermediaries that you work with and the type of clients you have or are targeting is also important. The way you articulate<br/>your CIP, and indeed what are appropriate instruments, will be different if you deal with professional introducers and high net worth entrepreneurs, or if you only deal directly with elderly retired people. But it is always worth keeping it as simple as possible (and that takes time!)<br/>Asset managers will have a document that outlines their core beliefs and how they implement these beliefs – an Investment Philosophy and Process. It is a simple<br/>idea – once you know what you believe (Philosophy) it is relatively straightforward to implement it (Process). Trying to run<br/>a process without having the guiding philosophies in place is nigh on impossible and risks delivering inconsistent outcomes. The key for adviser firms is to be able to evidence their beliefs. The importance of costs, the key role that asset allocation plays in long-term returns, and the fact that diversification helps deliver a better risk adjusted return might feature.<br/>An Investment Philosophy and Process<br/>Creating a simple investment philosophy folder that stores these beliefs and critically the evidence for them would be a good first step – and something that product / risk tool providers will be able to assist with. This might be updated annually.<br/>A simple checklist example is shown in figure 1.<br/>Figure 1: Investment Philosophy Checklist<br/>PHILOSOPHY<br/>EVIDENCE<br/>Long term returns<br/>Barclays Equity Study<br/>Importance of asset allocation<br/>Brinson, Beebower, Hood and others<br/>Importance of costs<br/>FCA Asset Management Study / Morningstar<br/>Diversification<br/>“Quilt” Chart (below)<br/>Link between risk and return<br/>Risk profiling tool provider<br/>Active and passive or blend<br/>Product providers / internet search<br/>Importance of risk profiling<br/>Adviser own wording<br/>Need for a plan<br/>Adviser own wording<br/>Tax and access<br/>The value of tax planning<br/>Pre-funding (esp. for model portfolios)<br/>Platform due diligence<br/>It is worth recording examples of how the adviser adds value at each of these steps.

This is a good piece of evidence for your investment philosophy as well as a good visual sales aid to use in client facing documents.<br/>It is important to have a terms of reference (ToR) for your investment committee / meetings (more later). Quarterly meetings seem most popular but this varies by firm type (those with Discretionary permissions will be more frequent). Several firms review<br/>a different element each quarter by rotation e.g. Q1 - Investment Philosophy / ToR update and performance review, Q2 - Platform Due Diligence, Q3 - Equity Instrument Review and portfolio performance review, Q4 - Bond and Property Instrument Review.<br/>Figure 2. Diversification Quilt Chart<br/>Risk tools typically use some form of optimisation model (e.g. mean variance optimiser) to construct an efficient frontier from which the risk and return can be derived. The tools use long-term asset class return, volatility and correlation assumptions to attempt to build the optimum portfolio for each level of risk (as measured by volatility). This derives the strategic asset allocation benchmark for portfolios.<br/>Risk tools and asset allocation assumptions<br/>The assumptions used by most optimisers are based on some form of historic data. These may be adjusted for expected future returns to make them more forward-looking than just backward-facing. It is helpful to understand and document these assumptions. The investment committee would wish to sense check these assumptions as the data that is used as inputs to these tools is critical to the output. Small changes to long-term return assumptions can make substantial changes to the asset allocation for a given risk profile.<br/>It is also important that advisers understand whether the optimiser outputs are real (after inflation) returns or nominal.<br/>The Barclays Equity Gilt Study is a good source of long-term returns but care needs to be exercised.

By the time rebalancing dates came around, the UK’s largest open-ended funds had locked their gates amid massive outflows. A further disadvantage is portfolios are always done at a specific date and time, which puts them at disadvantage – they all rebalance at the same regular dates, so other people in the market know they’re coming – and they are locked-in for months, regardless of what happens.<br/>Most people are more concerned about losing money than making high returns. Unlike many of our competitors, our fund managers have<br/>a clear target for risk as well as returns, giving them explicit boundaries for the appropriate level of risk that they can take. There is a range of six strategies to suit different appetites for risk and return; from ‘low’ through to ‘high; targeting ‘6-month LIBOR+2%’ (cash plus) through to ‘CPI+5% plus’ (inflation plus over 5%). It offers a private client level of reporting, and we believe that this combination will prove an attractive addition to Rathbones’ range of investment services.<br/>Some advisory clients want service and bespoke advice from an ongoing relationship with their Discretionary Fund Manager. Others, working with their investment adviser, are clear about their goals and want a simple and straightforward execution-only investment service - less personalised for now, but without sacrificing the balance of quality, relevance and value that is currently missing from this area of the market, heavily populated with ‘model portfolios’.<br/>The Rathbone Managed Portfolio Service complements our other offerings to clients, from single strategy funds to bespoke discretionary portfolio management.

This portfolio is valued on a regular basis, but is owned via the investment trust structure, which itself is traded like any other listed company’s shares. This means that the<br/>market’s valuation of the investment trust can diverge (both positively and negatively) from its valuation of the portfolio resulting in the trust trading at a premium or discount to the implied valuation of the underlying portfolio.<br/>The closed-ended nature of investment trusts allows fund managers to invest in more illiquid assets than he or she might otherwise be able to invest in via an open- ended fund as there are no inflows that might dilute (or outflows that might disrupt) the make-up of the portfolio. This enables us to gain access to a far wider pool of investment opportunities within our two Funds of funds, Vanbrugh and Distribution. In turn, this gives us access to asset classes that might behave very differently from, and are valued more cheaply than equities and bonds that are typically held in open- ended funds. Owning assets that perform<br/>in different ways at different times (i.e. that have low or negative correlation) assists greatly with portfolio construction. If we only owned assets that always acted in the<br/>same way, we would have a portfolio that potentially could suffer much larger swings in value than would otherwise be the case. By owning cheap assets that behave differently we can dampen these swings in value without sacrificing performance. Over recent years the performance of traditional assets, such as bonds and equities, have become<br/>far more positively correlated and so being able to access different asset classes via investment trusts has materially improved our performance relative to much larger funds of funds that only invest in unit trusts and OEICs.<br/>We can also exploit inefficiencies in investment trusts and the fact that they trade at premia and discounts to our advantage. We often purchase them at a discount (effectively buying a pound worth of assets for less) and hope to sell them at a narrower discount or even a premium. This return is in addition to the underlying return we receive from the portfolio’s gain in value.<br/>Owning assets<br/>that perform in different ways at different times (i.e. that have low or negative correlation) assists greatly<br/>with portfolio construction.<br/>","27<br/>Being able to access different asset classes via investment trusts has materially improved our performance relative to much larger funds of funds that only invest in unit trusts and OEICs.<br/>Of late, the weakness in the pound has encouraged overseas buyers to opportunistically purchase cheap sterling assets.<br/>The types of assets we hold via investment trusts include loans, private equity, property, asset-backed securities and more illiquid parts of global equity markets (such as “Frontier Markets” and “micro-cap” equities).

An average annual return of approximately 5%, compounded over a quarter of a century. Few, if any, would be disappointed with that return whatever their risk appetite.<br/>Over that same period, thousands of<br/>active fund managers have attempted to out-perform indices. These active fund managers charge a premium (usually their Annual Management Charge) and attempt to generate ‘alpha’ for their investors.<br/>Alpha is the return achieved in excess of<br/>the benchmark. The IA Flexible Investment Sector reflects the performance of active managers seeking to outperform the equity markets. Whilst not all of these invest solely in the UK, there are high correlations across<br/>global equity markets and the return of the IA Flexible Sector over the 20-year period was +239%.<br/>So why is it so difficult for active managers to outperform an index? I have previously explained the punitive, and hidden, charges involved in running an active mandate. Charges make life extremely challenging for an active manager, but there are still those whose funds can absorb them and achieve alpha. The questions are just how good do<br/>they have to be, and does that represent a sound investment?<br/>The 20 years in question comprised 5,216 trading days. The active managers identified their highest conviction trades, incurred<br/>the trading charge for implementing them, and waited for the binary outcome; would the value of their position go up or down? Sometimes the move was logical, other times it seemed to defy logic. The better managers won on trades more than they<br/>Charges make life extremely challenging for an active manager, but there are still those whose funds can absorb them and achieve alpha.

However, the problem is that not all trading days are equally important and if you aren’t invested on the most important days, the impact can be devastating. So how significant are the most important days out of 5,216?<br/>The FTSE All Share Index made +268% over 5,216 days. If you had tracked the index, and missed just the 5 best days (0.10% of the days) your return would have reduced by almost half to +153%. If you missed the 10 best days (0.19%) you would have gained +99%; missing the 20 best days (0.38%) reduced the return to +31% and missing the best 25 days (0.48%) would have seen you barely break even at +9%.<br/>Perhaps most astonishingly, if you were unlucky enough to miss the best 30 trading days (0.58%) you would have lost money with a return of -8%. That is to say you could have been invested for 5,186 of the<br/>5,216 days, or 99.42% of the time, and you would have lost money. Meanwhile the person that remained fully invested throughout, would have made +268%.<br/>Whilst there are undoubtedly some extremely capable investment managers<br/>in our industry, nobody has the ability<br/>to predict the future. Timing the market consistently over a long time-frame is practically impossible and attempting to do so can detrimentally impact the returns on offer. In order to maximise one’s long-term investment return there is a compelling argument for populating a portfolio with long-only index-tracking, or Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).<br/>Assuming the portfolio is well diversified, managed daily and structured in the most cost and tax efficient manner, investors can remain invested 100% of the time and reap the benefits on offer.<br/>Pay a fund manager to “time the market” (in the hope of achieving alpha) and money can be lost simply by being “out of the market” on only a small number of days that are usually impossible to predict. Using our example, had you missed out on just 30 days in 20 years you would have lost money.<br/>Conversely if you had just sat tight your initial stake would have almost quadrupled!

The rational is that by relying on the natural yield from their portfolio, retirees can avoid drawing on their capital or selling fund units, thereby avoiding the dangers of sequence risk.<br/>The natural yield approach contrasts<br/>with the total return approach, which essentially ignores the difference between capital growth and dividends, and instead seeks to draw income from both in a sustainable way.<br/>The natural yield approach is bandied about by some asset managers, who promise ‘stable natural yield’ to retirees. So it’s no surprise that the industry and consumer financial press is awash with articles<br/>on natural yield. A recent article in The Telegraph sums up the approach rather nicely: “The idea is to ignore the fluctuating capital value of a portfolio and only take the natural yield. An original £100,000 investment might dip to £80,000 or rise to £120,000 in terms of value, but investors should resist the urge to touch the capital.”<br/>The trouble is, this approach is bonkers for several reasons.<br/>• Dividend and bond yields fluctuate over time. This means that a retiree’s actual income will change significantly from year to year. This creates an unacceptable level of volatility in their income and makes budgeting nearly impossible.<br/>• Once adjusted for inflation, natural income is highly unlikely to meet the spending pattern of most retirees, bar the very wealthy.<br/>• Proponents of a ‘natural yield’ retirement strategy have offered little empirical evidence to back their theory. They erroneously focus on recent percentage yield of the FTSE 100 or FTSE All Share. Most retirees are more likely to have a portfolio consisting of bonds and shares, at the very least. And it’s crucial that any retirement income strategy works over a very long period and under various market conditions, including the extreme ones!<br/>The Big Test<br/>So in this research, I set out to examine the natural yield approach to retirement income, using empirical data. This time, I’ve used the Barclays Equity Gilt Study (BEGS) dataset from 1900 to 2015, which decomposes equity and bond returns into capital growth and income yield.<br/>• I created a portfolio consisting of 50% UK equities and 50% gilts, which is rebalanced annually.<br/>• I examined the real natural income on<br/>a £100,000 portfolio for retirement periods starting in 1900,1905,1910,1915 .... to 2005 and 2010. I also included a retirement period starting in 2008, just to take my total number of scenarios to 20!<br/>• Based on the dataset, I looked at a retirement period of 30 years. Retirees starting after 1985 haven’t completed the full 30 year period yet, so I’ve presented<br/>","Real Natural Income Yield From £100,00 Initial Portfolio<br/>First Year, Lowest, Mean and Highest Real Income Yield for Each Retirement Period<br/>31<br/>their results for the period covered so far. For instance, a retirement period starting in 1990 (Class 90) has had 25 years so far and a retirement period starting in 2000 (Class ’00) just 15 years!<br/>• The real natural income is the natural income from the outstanding portfolio, adjusted for inflation. I work on the basis that no income is taken from the capital and the retiree relies entirely on the natural income of their portfolio.<br/>• No fees/taxes are applied to the portfolio. Obviously, the net natural income would likely be lower after fees/ taxes and the key points hold regardless.<br/>The Result<br/>The chart below shows the real natural income from the portfolio over the subsequent 30 year period (or less where applicable i.e. retirement dates starting after 1985).<br/>income over the entire retirement period. I also show the ‘income volatility’ in %, which is the standard deviation from the mean income over each retirement period.<br/>The implication is that a retiree living off natural yield may or may not start off with a decent income in the first year of their retirement. But they should expect their income to fluctuate like a yo-yo from one year to the next. And once you add in the effect of inflation, this yo-yo effect (income volatility) is simply unacceptable for most retirees.<br/>Chasing Yield<br/>Of course, a proponent of natural yield<br/>will argue that a natural yield portfolio will specifically overweight high-yield assets such as high-dividend equities, commercial property, REITs and high-yield bonds.<br/>A recent paper by Vanguard lays bare the flaws of this thinking but I want to pick out these key drawbacks<br/>• High-yield asset classes such as commercial property/REITs, high-dividend equities and high yield bonds tend to have large drawdowns, particularly during stressful market conditions. The chart below shows the cumulative total returns during the global financial crisis (12 October 2007 to 9 March 2009) of major asset classes, including high-yield ones during the financial crisis of 2008.<br/>As you can see, income yielding asset classes experienced larger losses. It’s crucial to remember that, even if the income yield in percentage terms on these asset classes remains consistent (which they mostly don’t), the actual income received by the retiree in £ is still affected by the large capital drawdown.<br/>• Over-weighing high-yield asset classes invariably increases concentration risk and reduces diversification in the portfolio.<br/>• There is some empirical evidence to suggest that high dividend stocks tend to outperform over the very long term. But this is more likely to be due to value premium (i.e. equities with a low price- to-dividend ratio or frankly low price- to-anything ratio). Fortunately, there are better ways to capture value premium than price-to-dividends. Using price-to- earning or price-to-book is a far more effective way to achieve this.<br/>• The strategy relies heavily on the ability of the manager(s) to select high-yield stocks, bonds, property, before the fact, consistently over the very long retirement period. Good luck with that one.<br/>The implication of all this is that a natural yield approach is a bonkers retirement income strategy for virtually all but very wealthy retirees, who mostly rely on other sources of steady income.<br/>www.finalytiq.co.uk www.twitter.com/AbrahamOnMoney abraham@finalytiq.co.uk<br/>As you can see, regardless of the retirement date, a retiree relying only on natural income experiences a significant fluctuation in their income from year to year.<br/>Take for instance, our Class 1900 who started their retirement with a natural income of £4,550. By the second year, their inflation adjusted income fell to £3,897 and by the 5th year it was £3,005. But their troubles were only just beginning; by their 20th year in retirement, their real income yield had fallen to £1,024! I know no retiree on the planet who would consider these levels of fluctuation in their annual income to be acceptable.<br/>In the second chart below, I show the first year’s natural income, as well as the lowest, the mean and the highest real natural<br/>","32<br/>How do you select a DFM?<br/>Geoff Mills | Director | RSMR<br/>As part of our evolving services for IFAs, we have now extended our range of RSMR ratings to cover the discretionary fund management (DFM) sector.<br/>The ever-shifting economic environment over<br/>the last few years has proved difficult for many investors, professional or otherwise, and has required a significant amount of patience and skill to seek out areas that can offer<br/>some return.<br/>Use of DFMs has increased in popularity<br/>as a way of helping to take away some of the stress of selecting assets, allowing the adviser to focus on the many other areas of financial planning.<br/>Yet the choice now available means that selecting the right option from the market<br/>is increasingly difficult, and when taking account of the breadth of complex investment instruments used to form solutions, the apparently simple approach has become all the more complex.<br/>So why did we do this?<br/>Our new designation has been developed in response to adviser demand for additional clarity in the selection and use of DFMs. The rating is supported by our DFM matrix and factsheets, and our detailed DFM profiles.<br/>The DFM rating indicates that we have assessed the whole proposition against our methodology, and are happy to endorse its use. Of course under a DFM umbrella there can be a number of services, from bespoke portfolios to more generic unitised fund ranges. Where we have rated a DFM, we have effectively rated all of the services that fall within that.<br/>As part of our preliminary work in the creation of a rating for DFMs, we wanted<br/>to understand more about the market, and how it was viewed. In order to do this, we completed a survey with our adviser clients, which revealed some useful information about how they viewed the DFM market.<br/>Firstly, we wanted to understand the size of the market, and we found that 80% of the adviser firms currently use DFM services for some of their clients, and of these, nearly two-thirds expected future levels of DFM business to increase. Just 5% felt that volumes would decrease.<br/>Only 22% of the adviser firms felt that their needs could be met from a single DFM, and the remaining 78% are using or would use more than one. ‘Full’ discretionary services were used far more than model portfolio services (MPS) – around three times as much.<br/>We then wanted to look at how advisers choose their DFM provider, and the following summarises the highest scoring criteria:<br/>• the investment structure, processes and resources of the DFM – 93%<br/>• size and reputation of the DFM management team – 83%<br/>Finally, we wanted to understand if an RSMR rating that was awarded to DFMs meeting a required standard of investment capability would be useful, and a unanimous 100%<br/>of firms confirmed they would – of which two-thirds said they would value such a rating very highly. This was a clear confirmation that development of an investment-focused rating was desirable.<br/>","33<br/>The first and most important step in this process is to determine the investment experience and expertise of the DFM and their ability to sustain the highest levels of achievement over the medium to longer term.<br/>Our approach<br/>Our approach to the provision of ratings in the DFM market is very similar to that used for single strategy and multi-asset funds, but with the specifics modified to take account<br/>of the DFM market. In all these areas, we apply a straightforward, robust, repeatable process using appropriate criteria to arrive at a balanced view of the overall proposition.<br/>There are many important factors to be researched and assessed. We believe that the first and most important step in this process is to determine the investment experience and expertise of the DFM and their ability to sustain the highest levels of achievement over the medium to longer term.<br/>Our approach to DFM rating, as with all<br/>our ratings, places far greater emphasis on qualitative factors which reflect the integrity and effectiveness of the investment structures and processes, rather than judging primarily on performance.<br/>We provide fact sheets and other documentation about rated firms and our selection criteria to advisers, as evidence<br/>of the robust and rigorous process we have carried out. These will assist with recording of stages in the due diligence process and in the development of any client-facing material.<br/>Support material for advisers<br/>All of the support material is available on the Research Hub – http://members.rsmgroup. co.uk – and is summarised as follows:<br/>DFM rating – only DFMs that have successfully passed our rigorous and robust methodology will be awarded our coveted<br/>‘R’ designation. In giving this rating, we are confirming that our research shows the DFM to have a sound investment process and that our analysis of the performance and risk of the DFM is in line with our expectations. This designation, and the methodology used can form the basis of your due diligence.<br/>DFM factsheet – this gives you background information and a concise opinion on each proposition which can help you to narrow down your selection, and can be used as part of the justification for your choices.<br/>DFM matrix – to help further with comparing the DFM propositions, we have put together a matrix which will allow you to easily see and compare the rated DFMs, giving basic details in areas such as financial strength, services offered, assets under management etc.<br/>DFM profile – along the lines of our successful fund profiles, this will be an in-depth document providing full details of the investment processes that are in place, the team that manage the money, and their backgrounds and expertise.<br/>With the introduction of the new DFM rating, we have made our adviser support even more comprehensive. As covered earlier, all our ratings are founded on a strict methodology that considers performance and risk measures but places a greater emphasis on the ability of fund managers and investment providers to continue to deliver performance in the years ahead based on our in-depth research and face-to-face meetings with them in the UK and across the globe.<br/>www.rsmr.co.uk<br/>Email: geoff.mills@rsmgroup.co.uk Research Hub – members.rsmgroup.co.uk Twitter: @RSMRTweets / @thegeoffmills<br/>","34<br/>Takeovers and investing for the long term<br/>James Nield | Investment Manager | Thesis Asset Management<br/>What do BAA, BG, SAB, P&O, ICI and ARM have in common? They are all UK companies which have been the subject of takeovers, in all but one case by overseas buyers. Three of these transactions rank in the largest ten UK acquisitions in history.<br/>The table opposite provides some outline details of these transactions; others in<br/>the last ten years or so include Boots, O2 and Corus, not to mention the series of transactions involving UK banks during the financial crisis. Even now Sky is the subject of an offer from its related company 21st Century Fox, having previously been in talks with News Corporation. So let’s look at the factors which motivate buyers and sellers alike. Do these deals genuinely ‘add value’? Should investors buy shares in companies on the basis that they might be taken<br/>over for a premium valuation? Are there common themes which run through the transactions mentioned here and the others which are not?<br/>Market values<br/>Anyone who keeps an eye on markets will know that share prices fluctuate on a daily/ hourly/minute by minute basis. So does that mean that on such a short term basis investors are altering their views on the value of the particular company? Of course<br/>not. As in any other market the behaviour of buyers and sellers is driven by a large number of factors. These include the oft quoted human sentiments of ‘fear and greed’; the availability of alternative (more attractive?) investment opportunities elsewhere; the investment time horizons of the respective market participants; the presence of a particularly large buyer or seller who<br/>might influence the price; regulatory and<br/>tax matters. The list goes on. In all these takeovers the deal has taken place at a price well above that prevailing in the market before its announcement. On the whole investors demand this compensation for missing out on potential future growth in the company, and they ultimately show their<br/>acceptance of the deal by voting in favour of it (or not as the case may be). So how can a corporate purchaser justify paying a price well above the market’s prevailing valuation, and with the benefit of hindsight have they been right to do so?<br/>Short versus long term<br/>One explanation of a company’s ability to pay a higher price than normal day to day investors relates to a discrepancy in the<br/>way that the various parties’ performance<br/>is assessed. Almost 60% of all quoted UK shares are owned by institutional investment managers. While the underlying investors may well be private individuals, their funds are pooled and invested on a collective basis.<br/>","35<br/>At Thesis we screen the FTSE 350 using a proprietary process, the top quintile output of which gives our research team a universe of 70 companies to analyse on a fundamental basis.<br/>There are many benefits to this approach but one of the downsides relates to time horizons.<br/>Institutional investment managers are paid by their clients to outperform the market. Investors can become impatient during periods of underperformance which can lead to a tendency for short-termism. Analysis<br/>of investment performance on a quarterly or even monthly basis can incentivise such managers to accept offers from corporate acquirers at prices below their genuine opinions as to valuation.<br/>Corporate managers on the other hand<br/>can often take a longer term outlook.<br/>Many companies exist for decades and decades and their fortunes can be built on strategic decisions which have a multi-<br/>year perspective. While the directors of companies are not immune from short term pressures (from shareholders for example), they can use this timescale mismatch occasionally to their advantage.<br/>A prime example of this is the acquisition<br/>of UK software company ARM Holdings<br/>by Japan’s SoftBank. In the immediate aftermath of the EU referendum result the ARM share price did not suffer as badly as many, however sterling did and this may well have proven the catalyst. Markets gave the result the ‘thumbs down’, selling sterling against most other currencies. At one point sterling had weakened by over 20% against the yen, making a UK acquisition for a<br/>Japanese company all the more attractive.<br/>I am certain that the referendum result<br/>was on the agenda for discussion round<br/>the SoftBank board table but one can only assume that the long term, strategic benefits of the transaction outweighed any concerns relating to the UK’s political status in Europe. Short term market behaviour (in this case<br/>in currencies) can facilitate longer term corporate strategies.<br/>Control<br/>Another reason for takeovers taking place<br/>at a premium is that control of the entirety of a company itself has a value relative to owning a small part of it. Management control allows the acquiring company to set the strategic outlook for the business, and often the combination of the two businesses will enable one or both of them to do things they could not have done before. The much vaunted management synergies highlighted in corporate transaction documents often have a meaningful value and these can only be realised with full ownership. This is not limited to cost savings but can also involve the sharing of information/technology/ processes etc to enhance the products or services offered by the combined entity. These are benefits that can only accrue to<br/>a corporate acquirer rather than a minority shareholder, providing another justification for such deals.<br/>Thesis<br/>At Thesis we screen the FTSE 350 using<br/>a proprietary process, the top quintile output of which gives our research team a universe of 70 companies to analyse on a fundamental basis. The end result, following further qualitative analysis, is around 30 direct UK equity holdings across most client portfolios. This approach has exhibited twin benefits typically: investment performance and lower overall portfolio costs. Our approach is based on the notion that ‘good companies produce good results, good results produce good performance.’ We may well benefit from the premium delivered by an acquisition of one of our companies in the future. If a corporate acquirer sees the same merits as us then so much the better, but in the meantime we stick to our process and expect these companies to deliver positive returns nonetheless.<br/>Sources: Office for National Statistics; The Daily Telegraph; International Business Times; Reuters; Financial Times<br/>Email: james.nield@thesis-plc.com<br/>","36<br/>FCA Asset Management Review: Great news<br/>for investors<br/>RichardWithers| Headofgovernmentrelations|VanguardEurope<br/>The FCA is undertaking the biggest review of the UK asset management industry for many years – and we agree with many of their initial findings.<br/>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates the financial services industry in the United Kingdom, published its interim Asset Management Market Study last November. Running to some 208 pages, the report represents the most detailed regulatory examination of the UK’s asset management industry for many years. It’s an interesting read and contains a number of criticisms of the industry.<br/>The FCA gave asset management companies until February to respond. Vanguard submitted a detailed response, covering a variety of topics. I’ll highlight three of them here.<br/>1. Costs are too high<br/>We agree with the FCA that the cost of investing in the UK is too high. Like many industries, fund management benefits from economies of scale. That is to say, a £1 billion fund is not necessarily ten times as expensive to run as a £100 million fund. At Vanguard, our whole business model is built on this principle. We offer high-quality, low-cost funds, which deliver good results to investors, helping us to attract and retain assets, which give us economies of scale, so that we can lower the cost of investing further, and so on.<br/>However, the rest of the industry doesn’t operate on the same model. Competition has started to drive fund charges lower, but the industry needs to do more. We believe that lowering the cost and complexity of investing is the best way to improve the long-term financial health of the UK population.<br/>2. Performance is not good enough<br/>Every pound that investors pay in charges is<br/>a pound out of their potential returns. Hence, high costs act as a brake on fund performance and – counter-intuitively for many – lower- cost funds tend to outperform their higher- cost peers.<br/>We believe that lowering the cost and complexity of investing is the best way to improve the long-term financial health of the UK population.<br/>","37<br/>We’ve gone as far as suggesting that all funds should carry a health warning along these lines: Warning – Check how much you are paying – High fees will harm your long-term returns.<br/>Across the industry, too many funds fail to live up to their performance targets, partly as a result of the charges that they levy. Moreover, even those managers who do manage to outperform in a given year seldom manage to repeat the feat consistently.<br/>Since passive investing has started to become more popular, there has been an ongoing “active vs. passive” debate. We think this debate is outdated and should be reframed as high cost vs low cost. Why? Because research has consistently shown cost to be the best predictor of relative returns.<br/>In fact, we’ve gone as far as suggesting that all funds should carry a health warning along these lines: Warning – Check how much you are paying – High fees will harm your long- term returns. We’d also like to work with the FCA in designing a rating system to make it easier for investors to understand the relative cost of a fund. Red/amber/green rating badges seem to work well in other industries.<br/>3. Investors need better information<br/>To make informed decisions, investors need to have access to information they can understand. However, research we’ve recently conducted with Opinium LLP showed that investors don’t feel they have access to clear information. As a result, many investors<br/>still base their investment decisions on past performance, which has been shown to be a poor predictor of future success.<br/>Rather than focusing on past performance, we believe that investors will improve their chances of success if they are encouraged to think about the return they require in order to meet their goals. Selecting a low-cost fund designed to produce their required return, and then having the discipline to tune out short- term noise, will further improve their chances.<br/>Aligned with the FCA<br/>In summary, we agree with much of what<br/>the FCA says. Consumers will benefit from having access to better products with lower charges, and clearer information that allows them to make informed investment decisions. If the industry is truly customer-focused it will prioritise achieving progress on these fronts. We look forward to continuing to engage with the regulator and our peers on the topic.<br/>If you found this article interesting, you can read more commentary from Vanguard on our website: www.vanguard.co.uk/adviser/ adv/adviser-support/adviser-library/ research-commentary<br/>Important Information:<br/>Vanguard Asset Management, Limited only gives information on products and services and does not give investment advice based on individual circumstances.

Get your Synaptic Risk Ratings here - at no extra cost<br/>Eric Armstrong | Product Marketing | Synaptic Software Limited<br/>There is a terrific debate going on around the role of research (following on from FCA 16/1). It reflects the increasing importance of managing investment risk, the corresponding role that risk plays in a portfolio and how risk-based decisions about asset allocation are taking centre stage in determining investment strategies in firms.<br/>There is no bigger consideration than risk<br/>at the current time – which makes the fact that there is a lack of objective, quantitative research to support advisers in this area more surprising. It is timely therefore for Synaptic<br/>to extend the reach and depth of its research around risk, and publish their Synaptic Risk Ratings as an integral part of the Synaptic Product and Fund research tool package (which can be found in the investment product are of the tool).<br/>Reflecting the fast growth of this research area within Synaptic, counting over 20 fund groups, discretionary investors and wealth managers, Synaptic Risk Ratings will now be directly accessible in the day to day research of over 8k Synaptic software subscribers. This represents that most significant enhancement of the Synaptic proposition since the launch of Modeller several years ago.<br/>In providing advisers access to the Moody’s Analytics (formerly Barrie + Hibbert)’s risk<br/>framework, Synaptic already offers perhaps the most accomplished resource in managing investment risk. There are many reasons why Moody’s treatment of risk is pre-eminent:<br/>• Capture of potential downside. We can use hindsight to review the historic predictions and see that they have been accurate over many market cycles;<br/>• Capture of ‘tail risk’, including the 2008 ‘Great Depression’;<br/>• Ongoing due diligence. The capital market assumptions are what define the rules that underpin the model, and determine what<br/>is ‘feasible’. Moody’s model is constantly being reviewed and evaluated (internally and externally by the large institutions that rely on Moody’s expertise for their own forecasts).<br/>At any one time there is rash of commentators declaring ‘that things are different now’; that the bond bull market is dead; that the S&P is overvalued and therefore non-investable; that<br/>inflation will be rampant in 18 months time; that any one of many faddish ‘insights’ should determine your asset allocation. Heed these and you may be compromising your clients’ long term prospects. Good stocks may decline but they will also recover. Fads will leave you dead in the water - well diversified portfolios built using established research based principles will prevail. Stick to the Moody’s Asset Allocation model.<br/>The beauty of the stochastically generated, probability based projections, such as those that underpin the Synaptic Risk Rating service, is that you can quantify the extent of likely losses – which of course is what is the FCA wants you to do, empirically, according to its notion of Capacity for Loss.<br/>In Moody’s world for example, a Cautious investment strategy is one that ‘risks’ losses ofupto5%ina‘bad’year–thatistosaythe ‘bad’ year that is mathematically projected to occur once in a term of 20 years of investment.<br/>","RISK<br/>41<br/>Synaptic Risk Rating will provide the bedrock in terms of suitability - as it is unique in the industry as an objective and consistent measure for investment risk.<br/>Screen below shows format for new Synaptic Risk Metrics, incorporating RSMR commentary.<br/>Screen below shows Synaptic Product and Fund grid with Synaptic Risk Rated funds and portfolios. See column ‘Minimum gain’ for ‘Capacity for Loss’ quotient.<br/>The concept of ‘capacity for Loss’ is the most useful tool for an adviser if correctly measured. Even those invested in the 2008 downturn were fine as long as they didn’t cut and run.<br/>If their adviser had correctly judged their ‘capacity for loss’, they would have been within the Moody’s tolerances for loss and back on track. Too much risk in their portfolios and<br/>they would have certainly imploded, with a (legitimate) complaint ensuing.<br/>What are the Synaptic Risk Ratings?<br/>• On a quarterly basis, Moody’s update<br/>their Economic Scenario Generator, the mathematical, probability based model that underpins the Synaptic Risk Ratings.<br/>• The risk rated funds and portfolios are re-run through the updated model, projecting on the underlying asset allocation, taking into account the interaction of the various asset classes making up the investment in the multiple scenarios.<br/>• The results from these calculations allow Synaptic to calibrate the existing funds<br/>and portfolios against the Moody’s model, attributing a risk category to the investment, as well as a ‘decimalised’ number, ranging from 1.0-5.9, offering in effect 50 steps, or grades of risk exposure.<br/>• Obviously with the Synaptic approach, users can freely access the risk profiling questionnaire, Risk Categories and descriptions.<br/>• Users who use other systems than Synaptic or Moody’s for aligning risk can still include a Synaptic Risk Fact sheet with their compliance submission. The Capacity for Loss figure, which is the published as the ‘5% minimum gain’, or ‘one in 20 years loss’ is just as relevant a measure outside of the full Synaptic system.<br/>How should they be used?<br/>• The Regulator requires that a recommendation should be suitable on an individual basis. The metrics published as part of the Ratings can be related to any case. No recommendation should be made according to a single measure, but the Synaptic Risk Rating will provide the bedrock in terms of suitability – as it is unique in the industry<br/>as an objective and consistent measure for investment risk.<br/>Call us on 0800 783 4477 to gain access to the free Synaptic Risk Profiling Questionnaire, or visit www.synaptic.co.uk for more information.<br/>","F&C MM

Synaptic Software have requested asset allocation information from participating providers in a specific format aligned to the risk framework of the system. These asset classes are used by the model to determine the risk rating, a process that may result in a level of approximation though in most cases this will be insignificant. It is also possible that certain asset classes may not be represented exactly in the manner that providers would prefer.<br/>Reasonable endeavours are made to provide accuracy and consistency, however neither participating providers nor Synaptic Software can be held responsible for any errors or omissions.

These new style products are both fully underwritten up front but then have the premium amended each year based on a single risk factor of BMI (for weight) or HBA1c (for diabetes).<br/>Many will be watching how advisers and<br/>the public respond to these products. If they seem to take hold expect a slew of similar products, based around wearables and other health technology to enable the premiums<br/>to be more subtly varied.

This method is outrageously unsophisticated compared to methods applied to evaluate high risk applicants in other areas of the financial services world.<br/>In the medium term expect companies to move from tables to algorithms, bringing in more factors in order to judge the risk and whether it makes economic sense to get other evidence. Of course the type of evidence obtained is likely to change too – not just from paper to electronic GPRs but to more discrete testing as the quality of information held by<br/>a GP continues to deteriorate within a more<br/>fragmented NHS. The overlay of risk presented and usefulness of evidence considered should become more subtle and precise. As with most advances the challenge will be to do more with less – to target the evidence well enough that the predictions get better to mean less inconvenient testing and lower prices.<br/>There will be more information and interaction with answers given<br/>Today insurers seek congratulations for being polite enough to let a customer know why their premium has increased. In the future<br/>I expect more to not just to embrace that minimum element of respect, but go beyond this. The answers given are a potential way<br/>to start tailoring future dialogue – focusing health or travel guidance depending on what is known about the customer. Specialist advisers are currently leading the way with this – it will be interesting to see whether it is ultimately advisers or insurers who invest and make a difference in this space.<br/>Contrary to some surveys and many adviser’s wishes there will still be a load (if that is the collective noun) of underwriters in the future.<br/>o<br/>","ours<br/>53<br/>The one size fits all model is no more likely to fit for insurance than it is for any other retail model. Each individual’s prioritisation between time, price and product quality will vary and the best journey for them should flex accordingly.<br/>There will be more distinct approaches from insurers<br/>The one size fits all model is no more likely<br/>to fit for insurance than it is for any other retail model. Each individual’s prioritisation between time, price and product quality will vary and the best journey for them should flex accordingly. Insurers and tech companies need to get much closer to the front end triaging that provides the oil in existing journeys –<br/>the “so how healthy are you generally” type question that pushes them down one route rather than the other.<br/>Journeys like Cover Me Now offer a great solution for a healthy individual who wants<br/>a good price and product in quick time. Approaches for other niches including lives with specific medical conditions are also likely to be developed.<br/>There will be more underwriting of older lives<br/>For all the toes being dipped in insurtech waters there is a more compelling short term case for growth from an increase in Life, CI and IP products being sold to people who are retiring later in life. This should mean a differentemphasisinquestionsreflectingthe<br/>norms – for example asking “what medication are you taking” rather than “are you on<br/>any medication”. It will also require more understanding of the early signs of dementias and other conditions that affect people more in their 50s and 60s than 30s and 40s.<br/>Genetics won’t have radically changed the (insurance) world<br/>Advances in understanding of genetics are as rapid as they are excitingly transformative. This presents huge opportunities for medical science but the imbalance of knowledge caused specifically by genetic testing poses a large theoretical future risk to insurers. This gets talked about frequently – particularly regarding Critical Illness policies when insurers are putting prices up (although less so when customers are pushing for prices to go down for life insurance).<br/>There may be some areas where there are spikes in Critical Illness claims from a generous wording that gets picked off with later genetics advances. But the overall landscape will not create a catastrophic imbalance of knowledge requiring us to rethink the model altogether. Rather I see the deeper understanding of the interactions between genes and environment meaningthatpeopleappreciatebetterthan<br/>ever the variety of factors that cause and prevent conditions occurring. This may lead to a wider approach to underwriting, including more lifestyle factors – whether sought through questions or data from wearables rather than giving up altogether and adopting guaranteed policies more broadly.<br/>Underwriting will still exist<br/>Contrary to some surveys and many adviser’s wishes there will still be a load (if that is the collective noun) of underwriters in the future. The roles will evolve and more understanding of customers and their behaviours required to fulfil all the requirements above – but we’ll be here for a while yet, whether you like it or not!<br/>For more information on Cover Me Now see the article on pages 54 & 55 or visit www.synaptic.co.uk/covermenow<br/>COVER ME NOW<br/>","54<br/>COVER ME NOW<br/>Cover Me Now - Protection Cover as it should be<br/>Paul Quarendon | Product Manager | Synaptic Software Limited<br/>Progress can sometimes be measured in small steps, but the arrival of Cover Me Now into the market place marks a major step forward in an industry, which for years has been struggling to improve its customer engagement and sales performance.<br/>Uninsured debt in our country should keep Advisers and Providers up at night, but<br/>do they need to be with new onboarding systems making insurance a lot easier to access?
