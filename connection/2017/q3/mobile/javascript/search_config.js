Never has the role of Synaptic been more relevant. Whilst the quality of outcomes exists in most advice areas, the FCA is demanding better due diligence and evidence of research in files across the board.<br/>In this edition, we focus on our brand new research tool, Synaptic Analyser, combining all the elements of retirement planning including accurate enhanced annuity quotes, with accurate provider illustrations.

Advisers, and possibly clients, will have many years’ experience of the saving up phase – but very little of the drawing down stage, especially over extended periods.<br/>The need to access a sustainable inflation linked withdrawal rate while maintaining<br/>an appropriate level of capital is key. Rather than simply trying to maximise returns, investors are trying to maximise “durability” of income.<br/>This durability is one of the fundamental risks associated with taking a DB transfer.<br/>Pensions freedoms and home equity<br/>Recent changes in pensions legislation<br/>and the very high CETVs (Cash Equivalent Transfer Values) mean that for many people, their pension will become their largest asset – possibly of much higher value than even their home. It is therefore natural when faced with this large and important asset that people will want to preserve it. Unfortunately for many this will mean not taking any risk (risk of loss), and invest in cash. When in fact one of the most pernicious long-term risks is inflation – and cash is a poor asset to protect against inflation.<br/>The rapid rise in equity release products, and the improvement in the product over recent years, may also be a factor to consider in wider pension (long term income) provision.<br/>With sensible planning, it is now possible to pass pension wealth to future generations very tax effectively. This is assisted by the new Residence Nil Rate Band for IHT.<br/>The interaction between the pension and IHT tax regimes, the need for long-term income, the potential need for long-term care, the need for a diversified asset mix of real assets inside your pension fund (not just owning<br/>a residential property outside your pension fund), the tax-effectiveness of investing inside a pension wrapper, the triple lock (or double lock) on state pension benefits, the enhanced death benefits and IHT planning available under pension freedoms all serve to highlight the critical need for professional impartial advice when considering a full or partial transfer of DB scheme benefits.<br/>What is clear is that a simple critical yield assessment is flawed.<br/>The state of DB schemes<br/>One important factor to consider when planning to transfer from a DB scheme is the health of the scheme and the risk of it failing to meet some, or all, of its future liability.<br/>This takes on greater significance for those with higher benefits that are yet to retire (as the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) only covers pensions to a cap). The cap at age 65 is, from 1 April 2017 this equates to £34,655.05 (when the 90 per cent level is applied), set byDWP.<br/>Note: The PPF has approximately £3.5bn of assets and receives c £540m a year in levies. Level of UK DB scheme deficits is c£300bn. So, there is more than a little gap if there is series of large calls.<br/>Not so many years ago, a DB pension was deemed to be “guaranteed” but as we have seen with BHS/Tata and a myriad of smaller schemes which fail, often un-noticed, this concept is no longer absolute.<br/>It may be a better outcome for an investor with a full state pension entitlement, to spend their pension pot faster than a typical annuity / DB pension would allow while they are in good health. Knowing that they have significant home equity in their main residence to draw from in later life. So long as they understand the impacts and risks of this strategy the improved “quality of life” that they can enjoy for say 10 years with a higher income, could be a compelling reason for a DB transfer to access more flexible benefits.<br/>","5<br/>Not so many years ago, a DB pension was deemed to be “guaranteed” but as we have seen with BHS/Tata and a myriad of smaller schemes which fail, often un-noticed, this concept is no longer absolute.<br/>State of the pension nation<br/>Hymans Robertson research shows that:<br/>• DB liabilities are now greater than UK GDP<br/>• For many schemes benefits being paid out<br/>are greater than contributions being paid in.<br/>• An estimated £10bn a year will flow out of<br/>DB schemes<br/>Previous requirements for schemes to match their liabilities to bonds means that schemes have been holding the “wrong” long term assets (bonds) to meet long-term inflation linked liabilities. Indeed, any rise in inflation could lead to a rapid fall in bond prices further exacerbating the funding gap for DB schemes.<br/>High CETVs<br/>The very low bond yields have driven CETVs from DB schemes to very high levels. Some investors have seen the CETVs more than double in a very short period, and critical yields even being driven negative – CETVs more than 100 times the pension are not uncommon. It is exactly these long and sustained falls in bond yields that has driven transfer values from DB schemes up. As the discount rate has fallen, the cash required today to buy out a given liability has risen.<br/>Many commentators are concerned about the significant risk in bond markets that ultra-low yields have created – while there<br/>is currently no sign of a liquidity crunch, the prospect of rising inflation may trigger a rapid reversal of yields and sharp fall in bond prices. And as we have seen in credit markets historically this can be a rapid and violent change in direction.<br/>Note: CETVs are driven by the discount rate (usually long dated bond yields adjusted for the scheme asset allocation mix), inflation rates and the scheme demographics. Rising inflation expectations as well as falling long dated bond yields will typically increase transfer values.<br/>From a long-term return perspective, it<br/>is easy to see why a transfer value, based on bond yields of less than 1%, invested in a broad equity portfolio, with a 3-4% dividend yield could make a move from DB to DC worthy of consideration at least from an investment perspective.<br/>Particularly when you consider the<br/>steady rate at which dividends have been maintained by FTSE ALL Share companies see Figure 1.<br/>In the weeds<br/>Without seeking specialist advice, many clients will think there is a binary choice between DB “guarantees” or DC “non- guaranteed”. This does not have to be<br/>true: A strategy of utilising a short term (guaranteed) annuity to bridge the income gap to state pension age, or secure guarantee<br/>of nil rate income tax band for non-earners could be appropriate. Indeed, a single person with grown up children may be able to secure a guaranteed income equal to their DB scheme benefits and still have remaining cash. I would expect to see a rising demand for, and development in, the annuity market (long term guarantees up to 30 years) which offer valuable long-term certainty.<br/>One important factor to consider when planning to transfer from a DB scheme is the health of the scheme and the risk of it failing to meet some, or all, of its future liability.<br/>Figure 1.

Synaptic Analyser provides:<br/>1. State of the art cashflow modelling; 2. Research that provides calculations to<br/>help produce the new ‘Transfer Value<br/>Comparator’;<br/>3. Accurate quotes for retirement, including<br/>drawdown products.<br/>Most advisers will have noticed the upheavals in the pensions advice areas, and wondered what opportunities exist for them. Part of the disruption has come from the cessation of trading of various transfer specialists, the type<br/>that would review a case to allow an adviser recommendation to proceed. The regulator recognised that the process had been too compartmentalised, distorted by ‘contingent charging’ (incentivising the recommendation to switch, on which the fee was ‘contingent’).<br/>This is a significant transition period for our industry. The regulator is shifting the goal posts in a constructive way that requires firms to re-purpose their processes to re-centre<br/>on the client. By focussing on a ‘critical yield’ calculation, too little consideration was given to the client, either in terms of their objectives and wider circumstances, or in the subsequent execution of pension switching advice. This is a big upheaval as the current ‘value analysis requirement’ (TVA) is on the way OUT.<br/>The new Synaptic Analyser tool has been designed to cover several requirements, with the possibility of reducing the number of tools an adviser needs to purchase, or work with, combining retirement income modelling and drawdown analysis – designed to fulfil the financial planning requirements and due diligence for all kinds of pension advice in the new world. Synaptic Analyser will:<br/>1. Replace some of the tools that have previously provided TVA calculations This is good news as use of ‘defaults’ and ‘box ticking’ culture is baked into the<br/>shortcomings of these tools. Synaptic Analyser will provide a more up-to-date template for advice, including accurate ‘enhanced’ annuity quotes.<br/>2. ThecentralpropositionoftheCP17/16 paper is that consumer protection requires pensions advice to be ‘a<br/>personal recommendation’. Due in part<br/>to the relatively recent advent of high transfer valuations and the increasing precariousness of many schemes, a transfer is no longer deemed unsuitable by default, however removal of specific benefits are deemed to be unsuitable by default. So (3.10) ‘We propose to require all advice on the transfer and conversion of safeguarded benefits to include a personal recommendation’.There is further clarification in use of software:<br/>‘Adviser firms will be responsible for ensuring the APTA, including the TVC, is undertaken to a sufficient degree to support a suitable recommendation. Advice firms are liable<br/>for the advice even where it is checked by a third party pension transfer specialist. Consequently, advisory firms must make sure that any software used meets their advice needs’.<br/>","7<br/>This is a significant transition period for our industry.

Then they go into a less active stage where spending declines, only for it to pick up dramatically in later life due to care costs.<br/>Sounds logical, right?<br/>The trouble is, for the majority of people, this idea of ‘U-shaped’ spending in retirement is but a myth.<br/>For some time, researchers have identified an important phenomenon known as the ‘saving puzzle’ – older people keep accumulating assets in retirement and the amount of money they save increases with age!<br/>Dr Brancati and her colleagues at the<br/>International Longevity Center – UK<br/>recently conducted a detailed analysis of two large datasets; the Living Costs and Food Survey, and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, to gain insight into income and expenditure patterns of the older population. Their findings are set out in a recent paper titled Understanding Retirement Journeys: Expectations vs reality. The researchers note the absence of the U-shaped spending in retirement...<br/>Our findings suggest that typical consumption in retirement does not follow a U-shaped path – consumption does not dramatically rise at the start of retirement or pick up towards the end of life to meet<br/>long-term care related expenditures.<br/>At this point it should be noted that our data is restricted to households only and therefore excludes those actively living in care homes who may be paying for it from their remaining assets. Yet we can explore the extent to which care expenditures eat into household budgets across different ages. Analysis of the data suggests that even for the 80+ age group, only a minority (6.4% of households) are putting money towards meeting long-term care needs. This doesn’t mean that U shaped consumption<br/>in retirement is a misnomer, but perhaps implies that it is atypical.<br/>As it turns out, spending in retirement actually declines progressively in real terms. As people get older, they spend progressively less!<br/>A household headed by someone aged 80 and over spends, on average, 43% (or £131) less than a household headed by a 50-year- old. If we include the amount of money people pay for their mortgage as household expenditure, then the decline becomes even steeper with households headed by someone aged 80+ spending 56.4% less<br/>(or £173) than households headed by a 50 year old. Indeed, we calculate that by age 80+, individuals are saving, on average, around £5,870 per year. Figure 3 opposite shows that, from age 65, spending typically declines progressively and is about 35% lower at age 80.<br/>Even when researchers split people aged 50+ between top and bottom earners<br/>(i.e. people whose income is either<br/>above or below the median), the trend remains broadly consistent. People spend progressively less as they get older. However, high earners experience a much faster and steeper decline in spending after age 60 than bottom earners. Indeed, bottom earners have more stable spending patterns throughout their lifetime, and their total expenditure starts to decline only after age 70.<br/>The authors concluded that older people spend consistently less than their younger counterparts regardless of their income. This trend is persistent and it’s not a periodic effect.<br/>‘Consumption in retirement starts relatively<br/>","9<br/>Researchers have identified an important phenomenon known as the ‘saving puzzle’ – older people keep accumulating assets in retirement and the amount of money they save increases with age!<br/>Figure 1. Income and consumption expenditure at different ages<br/>high and ends low. This pattern is common to both high and low income groups, is robust to the inclusion of factors other than age and is not simply the result of the time period in which the data was collected.’<br/>Amazingly, this trend is broadly consistent even when<br/>you look at segments of people with different lifestyles.<br/>The authors note that even the “Extravagant Couples” – those who spend nearly 40% of their total expenditure on recreational goods and services – spend more than their income in the first decade or so of retirement, as do those who are “Just Getting By”, while the “Prudent Families” and “Frugal Foodies” consistently spend below their income over the duration of retirement All of the groups save in later life. From age 75 onwards, even the “Just Getting By” group, which is the lowest income group, starts to save. The savings are the consequence of falling consumption towards the end of life on non-essential items.<br/>These findings are consistent with findings in the US, where researchers found that retirement spending tends to decrease by at least 1% a year in real terms throughout retirement!<br/>Of course, many people will need care in later life, but this is not typical. Consider the following data from Age UK (2016). • only 16% of people aged 85+ in the UK live in care homes<br/>• the median period from admission to the care home to<br/>death is 462 days. (15 months)<br/>While it’s important to factor in possible care costs into a retirement income plan, the chances that someone actually ends up having to pay for care are relatively low. In any case, it’s entirely practical for people to rely on their property wealth to meet care costs in later life.<br/>So what?<br/>The assumption that income withdrawal needs to keep<br/>up with inflation throughout the entire retirement period<br/>is not supported by empirical data on spending pattern in retirement. This has a major implication for how we calculate sustainable withdrawal from retirement portfolios. An ideal sustainable withdrawal strategy should follow the typical spending pattern in retirement. This allows higher withdrawal at the early part of retirement and should progressively fall (at least in real terms) over their retirement period.<br/>Figure 2.

I’ll be having a moan about these as we go.<br/>Back to platforms. We speak to the platform providers regularly to find out what they’re up to, collecting loads of data in the process on a regular basis. In parallel to this, we also chat to lots advisers about how they’re feeling about this part of the industry, often helping them with their due diligence.<br/>(Moan #1, platform selection rather than due diligence please.) More on that later.<br/>What’s been happening recently then?<br/>So, I’m writing this at what feels like a strange<br/>juncture. In my 15 years in the industry there’s never been both so much and yet so little to talk about in the industry. On the one hand,<br/>if regulation is your boat, then there’s been<br/>no shortage of bedtime reading to keep you going in recent months.<br/>But let’s spare a thought for proposition developers inside platforms just now. Imagine you’ve got to contend with GDPR, the sequel to MIFID, the implications of the FCA asset management market study and the potential scope of the upcoming platform review. It’s overwhelming enough to make time to read all this legislation, let alone lead and develop a business through this.<br/>Looking specifically at the FCA studies, we think a few old friends are about to come into sharp focus once more. Value for money is one but is torturous to define, especially as<br/>value is something that is experienced by the user, not defined by a regulator, manufacturer or market commentator for that matter. Answers on a postcard.<br/>Superclean share classes and the increasing trend towards vertical integration (7 of the top 10 platforms by AUA have a fund manager in the wider group) are others and we’re going to be all over both in the coming months.<br/>Little wonder then that when we meet with platforms, we’re hearing a consistent message across the board that development spend is being swallowed up by de minimus changes to meet regulatory obligations. This is a market where innovation is being compromised at the hands of standing still. Leaving shmucks like me without shiny new toys to review.<br/>","11<br/>There’s never been both so much and yet so little to talk about in the industry. On the one hand, if regulation is your boat, then there’s been no shortage of bedtime reading to keep you going in recent months.<br/>And that’s before you talk about re- platforming, where we estimate that there’s around £800m being spent on in-flight projects with various providers upgrading or moving their kit.<br/>(Moan #2. Re-platforming is a horrible phrase. When I buy a new TV I’m not re-tellying. “Yeah love, I’m just off down to the shop to re- mobile,” said no-one ever. Give me ‘Technology upgrade’ or ‘moving to a new tech supplier/ version’ any day thank you very much.)<br/>This is all very interesting Steve, but what does this mean to me as an adviser? How do I go about my due dil...sorry...platform selection?<br/>Thanks. It’s not all bad news. We hear lots of criticism that platforms are becoming more vanilla – especially with the homogenisation of underlying tech. And in truth, while you can run a decent model portfolio CIP on most platforms, we think that criticism is generally a wee bit unfair. If you go digging then there’s a wider and more interesting variety of choice than initially meets the eye. Off the top of my head (there’s lots that didn’t make the cut here) you have:<br/>• Platforms like Nucleus, James Hay and Transact, who adhere closely to the original idea of what a platform was meant to be. Independent and investment agnostic – arguably leaving you more in control of your client proposition<br/>• Taking that one step further we’re seeing increased demand for the black-box enabling model from the likes of SEI, IFDS and Pershing<br/>• Towards the other end of the spectrum you have the likes of Standard Life and Zurich who are up there in terms of having the fullest propositions in terms of end to end functionality, tooling and support.<br/>• If your investment proposition favours a significant ETI component than platforms like Ascentric, Alliance Trust Savings, AJ Bell who have in-house dealing desks and as a result, fuller integrated trading capability.<br/>• And from an end-customer perspective, you have platforms like Seven IM and<br/>True Potential who do great work from a reporting perspective that sticks out a mile from their peers.<br/>But that’s all very high level, I want some practical help?<br/>Fair enough. We’ll end on some tips that we’ve picked up along the way when helping advisers with platform selection exercises:<br/>• The extremely patronising (sorry) but important one. Understand your own business model and what you need from a platform. For example, if you want to own your own tooling (i.e. risk profiling, CGT) proposition, then consider whether you need all the bells and whistles of some platforms - especially if those platforms are more expensive.<br/>• The exercise should be repeated for each of your client segments. One platform might be suitable across multiple segments but there’s a decent chance it wont.<br/>• Price isn’t everything. Something cheap and rubbish is still rubbish. You should see the first car I bought.<br/>• It’s a complex decision and it deserves<br/>to be treated as such. Be very, very wary<br/>of narrow metrics and flawed ratings. Profitability is a good example here. It can be a good proxy for business performance but only if understood correctly. For many platforms there simply isn’t a set of report and accounts that can be attributed solely to platform revenue and expenditure.<br/>• Make use of the information that’s already out there. *Advertising Klaxon* The lang cat has a free platform directory on our website. There’s lots of other tools and resources out there too.<br/>• You don’t need to ask every platform a matrix of several hundred questions (we’ve seen this). Consider the practicalities of what you’re going to do with all that data. Especially with all the regulation you’ve got to read!<br/>• If you go down an RFI question set then think very, very carefully about what you ask. If you ask 20 providers, “Are you committed<br/>to the UK market?” don’t be surprised if you get 20 answers that say “Yes”. Ask about the stuff that really matters to you as a business and be really specific in line with your business objectives.<br/>If you have any more, we’d love to hear your thoughts. Been nice meeting you.<br/>Visit www.langcatfinancial.co.uk for more from Steve and the rest of the lang cats.<br/>","12<br/>Fact or myth?<br/>Justin Onuekwusi CFA | Fund Manager | Legal & General Investment Management<br/>It is clear that both active and passive investments both have a role to play in portfolios. However, as the active versus passive debate rolls on, there are many myths on both sides about the advantages of one over the other. We look to dismiss some of these myths so investors can focus on the facts.<br/>Figure 1: United Kingdom<br/>2017 marks the ten-year anniversary of the beginning of the global financial crisis; a time when all investors could see was the ‘goldilocks economy’ and very few were concerned about the bears coming home. Fast forward to now and we are becoming more concerned that this exuberance is creeping back into markets. High equity valuations, structurally low bond yields and the continued spectre of political risk all present investors with real dilemmas. This has coincided with the growing popularity of index funds. Much of this popularity has been driven by the average active manager underperforming their respective benchmark. Many investors fear that recent index fund outperformance of actively managed funds<br/>is a function of upward trending markets and that if we see a correction or downturn in markets, active managers will come to the fore by boosting cash levels or allocating more to defensive stocks. Fact or Myth? We took a look back at every negative year for the IA equity sectors since the year 2000 and then reviewed how the average manager performed versus a comparative index.<br/>Active managers underperform in two out of three observations<br/>Firstly, looking at the UK market, the average UK equity fund has actually outperformed the FTSE All Share index since the year 2000. Many point to the mid-cap bias of the majority of active managers in the sector as the reason for this extended period of strong returns.<br/>However, what about when the average manager delivered a negative return? The results are close but the median fund manager underperformed in two out of three downturns, only beating the index when the dot-com bubble burst.<br/>","13<br/>Figure 2: United States<br/>Figure 3: Emerging Market<br/>Active managers underperform is four out of four observations<br/>The US market is seen as a poster child for index investing; thought to be one of the most efficient markets available to investors and therefore one of the hardest to beat. Unlike the UK market, there is clearly no contest here between the performance of active funds<br/>and the S&P 500. In every single instance of<br/>a negative return from the average manager in the IA North America sector, the index outperforms the median fund manager, often by a clear margin as shown in the global financial crisis and during the euro crisis.<br/>Finally, emerging markets equities – an asset class where it is often claimed that active managers should be able to add value. In contrast to the US, this is understood to be an extremely inefficient market, one which provides plenty of opportunities for nimble active managers with an informational advantage or the ability to identify mispriced stocks. However, this intuitive understanding misses a crucial aspect. The greater an opportunity for an accomplished active<br/>fund manager to outperform, there is an equally large chance that an unskilled, or perhaps just plain unlucky, fund manager<br/>will underperform. With this in mind, Figure<br/>3 showing the average active manager in<br/>the IA Global EM sector underperforms the index across each period is less surprising than previously thought.<br/>Active managers underperform is five out of five observations. The active/passive debate rumbles on.<br/>There you have it! The average active manager underperforms 11 out of our 12 annual observations. So, when it comes<br/>to the myth that active managers deliver superior performance than their benchmarks on the downside, that can well and truly<br/>be debunked- at least looking at the three markets above. The active/passive debate will undoubtedly continue with each side often taking pot shots at the other. Here it should be noted we have specifically looked at active managers versus a comparative index (the benchmark), and not versus index funds, which of course will bear their own charges. Ultimately, there are managers who can outperform their index but the investors needs to decide whether it is worth paying the extra fees for the potential alpha a fund manager may or may not bring.<br/>Multi-index investing: Keep active with index-like costs<br/>Within the LGIM Multi-Index funds, we believe in having the best of both worlds. Our active management of the asset allocation allows us to dynamically adjust the portfolio to respond to the ever-changing market environment. During anticipated periods of market weakness, we would look to de-risk the funds at opportune times, thanks to our assessment of the economic cycle, valuations and a range of systemic risks.<br/>Using predominantly index funds as portfolio building blocks means that we can pass on those cost savings to investors as well as benefit from the advantages of diversification. Yet, even Multi- Index does choose to invest in actively managed building blocks in some cases if it is the only way to get access to an asset class, or if that asset class lends itself more to active management.<br/>Offering a range of risk-targeted funds to suit the needs of any investor, we look to use every tool available to protect investors’ capital during the next potential downturn in markets.<br/>For further information about our Multi-Index fund range:<br/>0345 070 8684* fundsales@lgim.com lgim.com<br/>Important Notice<br/>This is not a consumer advertisement.

Experts are warning that January 2018 will be the deadline for getting your house in order in regards to risk profiling and the ‘use of tools’, as this is the date that the MiFID II legislation comes into effect.<br/>The Finalised Guidance document of 2011: ‘Assessing suitability: Establishing the risk<br/>a customer is willing and able to take and making a suitable investment selection’ set out the rules. Here the primacy of a client’s investment objectives was established, and the importance of linking objectives<br/>to appropriate risk-based strategies. It is<br/>a complex area, but these are essential concepts, and luckily they really work when put into practice.<br/>It is the responsibility of the adviser to ensure that ‘the client is able financially to bear any related investment risks consistent with their investment objectives’. Moreover, the adviser must ensure that the client has the ‘necessary experience and knowledge to understand the risks involved’.<br/>Here’s the punch line: the ‘route by which this key assessment is made is through the ability to assess a client’s ‘Capacity for Loss’.<br/>Many, if not most, complaints are upheld on the basis of whether a client’s risk exposure was suitable or not, based on their ‘Capacity for Loss’ (perversely in some cases, even when a client has done well).<br/>If this assessment is so important, where is it falling down for so many advisers?<br/>Thematic work has highlighted the poor use of tools, the lack of proof of suitability and failure to gain ‘informed consent’ around the risk inherent in the investment strategy recommended.<br/>Many advisers are conflating the outputs from their Attitude to Risk Questionnaire with their fuller consideration of the client’s<br/>circumstances. Capacity for Loss is different to the assessment provided by the questionnaire. It is an objective evaluation of the extent of losses that can be sustained before there is a ‘material impact on standard of living’.<br/>Simply asking a client to confirm their Capacity for Loss will not work, as it not a subjective response that is required. It requires the skill and objectivity of an adviser, who<br/>will balance what he or she knows about the client and their objectives, to recommend an investment strategy within their capacity to sustain possible losses.<br/>It also underlines why research and recommendations must be ‘personalised’. The wrong approach is to say: ‘The questionnaire says you’re balanced and you get portfolio<br/>5.’ Evidence of this truncated approach being used appears regularly in the trade press,<br/>","RISK<br/>15<br/>If this assessment is so important, where is it falling down for so many advisers?<br/>either in the many laments from the regulator following their review of files, but equally from practitioners who struggle to accept the limitations of these techniques, and in doing so fail to gasp their benefits.<br/>As providers of best advice tools, we get the equivalent challenge: ‘The questionnaire says 3, and the investment I want to propose is<br/>a 4. How do I get around this?’ The correct answer of course is ‘Let’s look first at the client’s objectives for this investment, assess their Capacity for Loss and see which strategy is appropriate’.<br/>A further pointer to success in our quest is in the nuanced wisdom that has always been present in the Finalised Guidance, that you cannot successfully match an investment recommendation with a client without credible research that quantifies potential loss. This shows us the real reason why so many advisers fail the proof of suitability<br/>test – they can’t actually provide a consistent projection that quantifies possible loss = leaving them hanging. They could say ‘In the great depression of 2008, representing the maximum drawdown for this strategy, we saw a loss of 15%’. This is going to prove difficult with investments that will have evolved<br/>in terms of construction and themes, and contain funds whose track records may not even extend further than a year or two. You need a much more circumspect approach.<br/>We at Synaptic believe that Moody’s Analytics are the greatest experts in meeting this mathematical challenge, which is why we have built our risk ratings on their model, rather than the ‘qualitative’ assessment offered by our competitors. In our tools<br/>and when we publish our risk ratings, we include the regularly updated, stochastically forecasted loss that is expected in a bad year for that investment or portfolio. That gives the adviser a consistent research-based measure to back up their consideration of Capacity<br/>for Loss, and the means of setting the client’s expectations. In doing so, the adviser will have avoided many of the pitfalls that improper use of tools presents.<br/>Capacity for Loss quotient highlighted: illustration shows graph from Synaptic Modeller with the likely portfolio loss in a (5% or 1 in 20) ‘bad year’. This calculation identifies this investment as an ‘adventurous’ strategy.<br/>Easy access to the Synaptic Risk Ratings<br/>Synaptic Product and Fund users can now access the full table of Synaptic Risk Ratings within the Investments tab of the research tool.

Synaptic Software have requested asset allocation information from participating providers in a specific format aligned to the risk framework of the system. These asset classes are used by the model to determine the risk rating, a process that may result in a level of approximation though in most cases this will be insignificant. It is also possible that certain asset classes may not be represented exactly in the manner that providers would prefer.<br/>Reasonable endeavours are made to provide accuracy and consistency, however neither participating providers nor Synaptic Software can be held responsible for any errors or omissions. No recommendation should be made solely on the basis of the Synaptic Risk Ratings, and additional research should be undertaken for any case.

Buy an annuity with your pension pot or receive a defined benefit pension and look forward to a regular income until you die. Pension freedoms changed all this. Clients now have more flexibility and choice, but there’s a potential downside too – complexity.<br/>Taking income – the client conundrum<br/>While greater flexibility and access is now<br/>on offer, security of income remains high on the list of priorities. The risk of running out of money has increased for many people since the Government removed safeguards like compulsory withdrawal (known as GAD) limits.<br/>Annuities may be unpopular, but the only way to have income certainty for life is to buy one – or another type of guaranteed product.<br/>For those who want flexibility and continue to remain invested, there isn’t a magic solution that delivers security of income.<br/>What this means for advisers<br/>Advisers have started to consider implementing Centralised Retirement Propositions (CRPs) that are distinct from the Centralised Investment Propositions (CIPs) used for accumulating clients. A one-size- fits-all approach is unlikely to be suitable, so a range of CRP investment solutions for different clients is appropriate.<br/>A CRP should be clearly aligned to different client segments, with appropriate investment choices and strategies depending on their wealth and needs. Retirement income planning and advice is complex and arguably the stakes are higher than for clients in accumulation.<br/>A CRP is not just about choosing a suitable range of investments. The framework also<br/>includes the factfind process and clearly understanding the client’s objectives. This will help identify the key risks personal to the client, and will shape a suitable retirement income strategy.<br/>Threats to retirement income<br/>The main risk is your client running out of money accounting for longevity, investment choice, their withdrawal strategy and any plans to leave a legacy.<br/>But making sure this doesn’t happen isn’t simple.<br/>As a financial adviser, you will understand the potentially devastating impact that might arise from the sequence of returns on a client’s investments. This risk arises when losses are<br/>","25<br/>For those who want flexibility and continue to remain invested, there isn’t a magic solution that delivers security of income.<br/>locked in due to the same level of income being taken from a portfolio even as it declines in value as a result of market volatility or weak investment returns. This is particularly acute in theearlystagesofretirement.Yourchallenge is to help your client understand this risk and enable them to mitigate it.<br/>Reduce retirement income risk<br/>Decide on the investment philosophy – total return vs natural income<br/>Consider whether a client’s income should come from:<br/>• natural income (the client doesn’t touch their capital); or<br/>• the total return of their investments (their income comes from their capital and any investment return).<br/>For clients with enough income from other sources, investing for and spending natural income is a viable option for discretionary spend.<br/>But natural income may not be sufficient for clients with more modestly sized pots. The unpredictable income level delivered and the investment risk they may need to take to generate enough income may make this strategy unrealistic.<br/>For these clients a total return approach, where the income is derived from a combination of income and capital, is likely to be required.<br/>Get the withdrawal strategy right<br/>There are several withdrawal approaches you can take – or combine – to reduce income risk. Suitability depends on individual client circumstances.<br/>• Come up with a sustainable withdrawal rate combined with a complementary investment strategy.<br/>• Be flexible with the amount of income the clienttakes,dependingonreturns.Youcould agree a cap on the amount they’ll take and, achieve this by not adjusting for inflation, limiting lump sum withdrawals or reducing the amount of regular withdrawals.<br/>• Consider a multi-pot strategy to manage income withdrawals across the short, medium and long term.<br/>1. Keep enough in cash to take income for an agreed time period (perhaps<br/>up to two years) so the client doesn’t have to draw down from their portfolio if markets drop. The downside is that lower returns can bring down the overall portfolio return.<br/>2. Ring fence the next three to five years’ income in a low risk stable asset.<br/>3. For longer term income needs that may demand longer term growth, invest in a well-diversified risk-rated investment solution such as a multi- asset fund.<br/>Perhaps the most important element is the client review. You’ll be well used to doing this with clients building their pots. But when they retire, it becomes essential in managing risk.<br/>Choose your investment structure – diversify through multi-asset investing<br/>A well-diversified portfolio is an effective way to shield clients from the effects of stock market volatility. You can achieve diversification in a number of ways – such<br/>as single multi-asset funds, selecting a fund panel to choose from, model portfolios and discretionary managed solutions. It all depends on the client and your advice proposition.<br/>Diversificationdoesn’tremovetheissueof sequence risk, but it can help to reduce the effect on the portfolio when there’s a market downturn by reducing downside volatility as a withdrawal is made.<br/>For many advisers, using straightforward risk-rated multi-asset funds can offer clients<br/>an easy, relatively low cost way to achieve diversification and improve the risk: return ratio. Diversification could go beyond the traditional bonds and equities split and offer exposure to different asset classes, geographies, liquidity, value and other criteria.<br/>High demand for multi-asset solutions continues to drive innovation and reduce costs in this space.<br/>In the Scottish Widows multi-asset Premier Range for example, strategies such as smart beta equity management and absolute return strategies increase diversification and potentially reduce volatility as a result.<br/>In summary<br/>The reality for clients and advisers is that investing in retirement can be a risky business.<br/>There’s no magic solution; but if you offer clients quality financial planning that considers the risks and solutions highlighted in this article, you can help clients achieve a comfortable retirement, and potentially leave a legacy too.<br/>For further information please visit:<br/>www.scottishwidows.co.uk/extranet/index<br/>","26<br/>Not all income is created equal<br/>David Palmer | Fund Manager | Sarasin & Partners LLP<br/>David Palmer is the appointed Fund Manager for the Verbatim’s Portfolio 5 Income Fund, where he is tasked with finding quarterly income, whilst pursuing capital growth in the medium to long term.<br/>In the diverse, bewildering world of equities, dividends are popularly seen as a reassuring mark of resilience and stability. Dividends indicate healthy free cash flow; the key<br/>input into a company’s discounted cash<br/>flow valuation, and the ultimate financial purpose of any equity investment. Regular cash payments are easy to understand compared to the esoteric world of share prices themselves, which can meander in response to an enormous array of considerations, some of which are logical, some not.<br/>The market equates dividends with financial strength, and dividend paying stocks provide an income stream capable of meeting the owners’ liabilities. In a world of abnormally low interest rates, where yield is so hard<br/>to come by, this is an ever more useful financial trait.<br/>It is also true that, over the long term, dividends are a key determinant of equity returns. In the UK market, for example,<br/>over four fifths of the equity market’s real return since 1900 has come from reinvested dividends. In the US since 1927, higher yielding stocks have outperformed zero yielding stocks<br/>by 2.8% per annum; an enormous quantum when compounded over a long period.<br/>By focusing on yield, one is therefore fishing in the right pond. Not only do dividends compound at a healthy rate over the long term, but by omitting stocks without them we also avoid the worst speculative excesses of the markets. Very few dotcom stocks, for example, paid any dividends.<br/>Bigger is not always better<br/>There is need for caution, however: while a high dividend yield can be the sign of a solid company throwing off more cash than it can use, a figure that is too high should give pause for thought. The maxim that ‘if something appears too good to be true, it probably is’ has enormous validity in the world of investment. Caveat emptor. Investors are justifiably suspicious of high-yield bonds (which are often labelled ‘junk’ for a reason) but are attracted to the supposed safety of high income equities. This is an inconsistent and illogical reaction. After all, dividends are only paid to shareholders after bondholders have received their interest.<br/>A very high yield can be a sign that the company is under financial stress, and may be forced to cut its dividend – generally<br/>an atrocious outcome for the owner. Furthermore, when we dissect the equity market, some of the highest yielding sectors are those normally associated with the highest risk, or the lowest quality.<br/>Telecoms, financials, oils and utilities are some of the most verdant areas of the market for yield, yet each of these sectors faces some profound issues. Telecoms are capital hungry, heavily regulated businesses, with a poor record of value creation. Banks are highly levered and have an unfortunate habit of periodically flirting with bankruptcy. Oil companies not only depend for their prosperity on a volatile and unpredictable commodity price, they also face huge operational risks (think about BP’s Macondo disaster, the bill for which is $47billion and counting) and, longer term, the risk<br/>of decarbonisation. Ditto utilities, whose coal and gas powered assets may be of little relevance in a world pivoting to renewable energy.<br/>","27<br/>In the UK market, for example, over four fifths of the equity market’s real return since 1900 has come from reinvested dividends.<br/>At the front of our mind is the truism that equities are long term assets, and that<br/>the bulk of their value is typically derived from cash flows expected to be generated well into the future. We therefore look for businesses and management teams that share our principles, and determinedly seek to build resilience. Are they prudent and sufficiently long-term in their outlook? Are they appropriately incentivised to ensure the perennial success of the business? Are the issues they face manageable at all, or is the business a structural short?<br/>Ask the right questions<br/>It is therefore critical that we individually assess the resilience of each company in which we invest to ensure that the dividend can continue to be paid, and preferably grow, ideally into perpetuity. There is a lengthy quantitative and qualitative financial checklist to ensure that any higher income stock has a sustainable yield. Is the dividend well covered by free cash flow? Is the balance sheet strong, with any leverage appropriate to the risks of the business? Does the underlying leverage differ markedly from that which the company reports? Are there other claims on cash flows from bond holders, pension funds etc., that come before equity owners in the capital structure? Are capital expenditures sufficient to ensure the business is nourished for future prosperity? Is the competitive environment manageable?<br/>At the front of our mind is the truism that equities are long term assets, and that<br/>the bulk of their value is typically derived from cash flows expected to be generated well into the future.

A “standardised template of costs and charges” will be introduced and significantly, this template will include an estimate of transaction charges. Transaction charges do NOT currently have to be included in the Ongoing Charges Figure (OCF) published by fund managers, and this leads to an incredibly misleading representation of the true cost<br/>of owning a fund for a 12-month period.<br/>For more information about how much these additional transaction charges can amount to, you can read our blog “Active Funds; why does nobody mention trading charges?” (blog.tavistockwealth.com):<br/>The issue is that an OCF represents the tip<br/>of the proverbial ice-berg. An active fund manager, in their quest to outperform<br/>a benchmark, must place a number of successful trades over time. Identifying these trades and recognising the right time to place them, are only two parts of the puzzle. Once an active manager decides<br/>to place a trade they must incur a cost for doing so. This cost may come in the form of<br/>a bid/offer spread, a brokerage fee or paying duties if purchasing an equity. Whatever the guise, an active manager must pay a cost when entering into every trade. To make matters worse, they must incur a further cost when exiting every trade. Therefore, if we make the (big) assumption that the average trade is successful, it must be successful enough to absorb two rounds of trading<br/>costs before it breaks-even for the fund. This is the best case scenario and by no means guarantees a significant contribution to fund performance.<br/>One study, which aims to shine light on the “invisible costs” of active fund management, looks at 1,758 equity funds around the globe. The study concludes that trading costs have a negative impact on performance and are, on average, larger than the expense ratios quoted by the active fund managers. Across the sample of funds, the average OCF was in the region of 1% with the average trading costs stated as an additional 1.44% per annum. For small-cap funds it was as high as 3.17% per annum. To be clear, these trading costs come in addition to the OCF published by active fund managers.<br/>The FCA has concluded that neither active nor passive funds outperform their benchmarks after their (all-in) costs and has found examples of “poor value for money products” in both active and passive strategies.<br/>","29<br/>The FCA wants to improve transparency and address “weak” price competition within the industry. A “standardised template of costs and charges” will be introduced and significantly, this template will include an estimate of transaction charges.<br/>Why they want it<br/>The FCA has concluded that neither<br/>active nor passive funds outperform their benchmarks after their (all-in) costs and has found examples of “poor value for money products” in both active and passive strategies. Going hand in hand with this is the FCA’s reiterated concern that investor “awareness and focus on charges is mixed and often poor” and that there are a “significant number of retail investors who are not aware” of all the charges they pay for their asset management service.<br/>What will happen to fund managers<br/>Fund managers who have historically included the bare minimum within their OCFs will now need to include an estimate for transaction charges. This will result in drastic increases in the average manager’s OCF. Our research shows us that an average OCF for a traditional active manager<br/>will be in the region of 1% however the average trading charges on top of this can be as high as an additional 1.5% (see our aforementioned blog on trading charges). Therefore, some managers will be forced to publish a new OCF that is more than twice as high as their previous one (2.5% vs 1%).<br/>Tavistock’s Approach<br/>would typically associate with a traditional active manager. Even when trades are placed, within an OEIC these trades are carried out in a fund structure which does not expose clients to significant additional transaction charges.<br/>We have always quoted our OCF inclusive of the underlying ETFs, the cost of currency hedging those ETFs, our Annual Management Charge, all necessary operating expenses and the running costs of the OEIC structure. Consequently, we believe our ACUMEN range to be amongst the most reliable methods of providing the “all-in” fee that the regulator is looking for.<br/>For more information about Tavistock Wealth:<br/>blog.tavistockwealth.com tavistockwealth.com linkedin.com/company/tavistock-wealth<br/>Source of data: Shedding light on ‘invisible’ costs: trading costs and mutual fund performance.

Thomas Wells, Fund Manager of the Aviva Investors Multi-asset Fund Range, explains the dangers of using volatility as your only measure of risk.<br/>Have any of your clients expressed concerns that their portfolio is too volatile? It would seem improbable. This is because from a client’s perspective, risk is losing money and not the volatility of returns. Despite this, the finance industry is fixated with using volatility as a measure of risk to the extent that the terms volatility and risk are used interchangeably.<br/>What are the pitfalls of volatility?<br/>• Volatility fluctuates over time<br/>This can be particularly problematic for portfolio managers who target a certain level of volatility. For example, a fund targeting<br/>20% volatility in 2011 would translate to a portfolio consisting of 100% global equity. Fast forward to 2017 and to achieve the same level of volatility, the portfolio manager would have to either leverage the portfolio or increase exposure to more volatile and risky assets.<br/>• Arbitrary volatility targets can lead investors down a dangerous road<br/>During low volatile periods, such as now, portfolio managers would have to add extra<br/>risks in order to achieve an arbitrary volatility target. When a period of market distress materialises, investors could lose more money than anticipated as portfolio managers are forced to sell risky assets in a declining market.<br/>Are we in a high risk or low risk environment?<br/>The majority of our investors perceive current market risk to be above average. This is hardly surprising given the busy political calendar in Europe and the uncertainties that surround the<br/>current US presidency. Yet when you look at volatility, it tells a very different story.<br/>What does this mean for volatility measurements?<br/>The graph below shows volatility across global equities is currently at unusually low levels, in fact one of the lowest points in the last ten years.<br/>Source: Bloomberg as at 28 February 2017. Rolling 3yr monthly volatility of MSCI AC Wold Index (GBP).<br/>o<br/>","ours<br/>31<br/>The finance industry is fixated with using volatility as a measure of risk to the extent that the terms volatility and risk are used interchangeably.<br/>Key Takeaways<br/>Source: Bloomberg as at 28 February 2017. Rolling 3yr monthly volatility of MSCI AC Wold Index (GBP).<br/>• •<br/>•<br/>Volatility is not necessarily a very good measure of risk, especially in isolation.<br/>There are pitfalls to blindly targeting an absolute level of volatility as a means of managing risk.<br/>Portfolio construction is important for delivering consistent client outcomes.<br/>The only way to reconcile this difference between investors’ perception of ‘above average’ risk and the unusually low levels of volatility we are currently experiencing is by recognising that volatility is not a very good measure of risk.<br/>If we look at 2007, this was another period where volatility was at an unusually low level. This was prior to the global financial crisis. While we do not believe this is an indication that we are at the point of the next financial crisis, it does teach us a useful lesson: volatility is not a very good forward indicator of risk.<br/>As you can see in the above graph, volatility increased at the same time as equity markets sold-off during the crisis. By blindly targeting volatility as a means of managing risk in your portfolio you would not have had time to de- risk your portfolio before the equity markets sold-off.<br/>The importance of portfolio construction<br/>Rather than narrowly focus on volatility, we believe at the heart of any successful multi- asset solution is a robust portfolio construction process. For the Aviva Investors Multi-asset Fund Range, we focus on three key elements: Strategic, Tactical and Implementation.<br/>• Strategic asset allocation<br/>This is where we create our long-term portfolios that are aligned to client risk profiles. We use longer term volatility and correlation measures which are more stable.<br/>We also believe in the merits of investing on<br/>a global basis to enhance risk-adjusted returns and help diversify the portfolio. Our multi-asset funds are fully unconstrained which means we do not follow a benchmark or peer-group. This gives us the freedom to invest where the best risk-adjusted returns are.<br/>• Tactical asset allocation<br/>To generate additional returns or to protect the portfolios, we make deviations from our strategic asset allocation in line with our House View.<br/>To select asset classes and regions, we use a combination of three factors – economic fundamentals, valuations and market sentiment.<br/>This helps us make well informed and reasoned adjustments to the portfolio.<br/>• Implementation<br/>We believe implementation is as important as idea generation. When we build portfolios, we take each asset’s contribution to risk into account and stress test the portfolios to help ensure that they deliver consistent client outcomes.<br/>Finally, any decision we make is backed<br/>by qualitative analysis; the application of experience and resources rather than relying solely on models and numerical analysis.<br/>Thomas Wells CFA®, Fund manager, multi- assets.

We expect this trend to continue.<br/>The constant hum of fears over deflation,<br/>or falling prices, has finally dissipated. Now, inflationary pressures – especially from wages – will prove crucial to determining the policy of central banks.<br/>Some are concerned that the US economic upswing is losing steam, given that it has been unusually protracted. However, the slower the pace of recovery, the longer it takes to absorb economic slack and the longer the economy takes to reach full capacity. A sluggish recovery, therefore, means the peak that signals the end of the economic cycle may take some time to be reached.<br/>That said, economic growth has shifted from acceleration to steady expansion. Over time, this should feed into upward pressure on wages and inflation.<br/>Are markets underestimating the risks?<br/>Because markets have been calm of<br/>late, measures of expected volatility are remarkably low, leading many commentators to argue that market participants have become complacent.<br/>However there have previously been long periods of market calm, punctuated by<br/>brief moments of crisis, meaning volatility does not always remain high. Consequently, today’s low-volatility regime may persist for longer than many expect.<br/>This presents us with an opportunity to mitigate the risk of owning equities via options. These strategies enable us to safeguard our portfolios without having to withdraw money from our favourite fund managers with whom we invest.<br/>Can current valuations persist?<br/>Since the financial crisis, most asset classes have performed exceptionally well – not least developed-market government bonds, whose yields remain stubbornly low despite steady economic growth and central banks taking steps towards removing stimulus.<br/>Even though we are yet to see wages grow at a pace that would stoke inflation – which erodes the value of the fixed payments offered by bonds and which central banks are tasked with controlling – central bankers are signalling a gradual end to emergency stimulus measures. These measures, such as asset purchase and interest-rate cuts have helped to suppress bond yields.<br/>As central banks become less accommodative, and inflation increases, long-term bond yields are likely to rise gradually, in our view, albeit to levels below historical averages due to structural factors such as aging populations, poor productivity growth and high debt levels across major economies.<br/>","33<br/>Growth in major advanced economies is rising at a rate that is slightly above the trend in place since the financial crisis, albeit at a slower pace than in previous economic cycles. We expect this trend to continue.<br/>Current investor sentiment is characterised by anxiety as to equity valuations, particularly in the US. But while the earnings yield for US stocks look expensive when compared to historical averages, it appears attractive when compared to bond yields.<br/>Moreover, as company earnings have<br/>been staging a recovery of late, it is not unreasonable to expect further gains from equities, despite the risks posed by the fact that labour shortages could cause wages to spike, eroding already-elevated profit margins.<br/>Where next for bond markets?<br/>We expect yields to climb, albeit gently, as steady economic growth is accompanied by rising inflation. At the same time, sovereign bond issuance for major developed economies is expected to be positive in 2018 for the first time in three years, meaning countries are issuing more debt than is being redeemed.<br/>But the rise in yields may be restrained by those deep-rooted factors we discussed earlier, as well as demand from investors, such as pension funds, which require bonds’ steady cash flows to match future liabilities.<br/>Company debt markets appear to be pricing solid economic expansion. Because the spread between the yield on company bonds and government debt has narrowed, as valuations have converged, future returns will probably come from income rather than capital appreciation. As any moderation<br/>in economic growth could lead to spread- widening, it pays to be selective.<br/>Against this backdrop, we have been increasing our exposure to alternative fixed- income assets, including tactical company debt funds, specialist credit and direct lending funds.<br/>Where next for equities?<br/>The global corporate earnings picture has certainly brightened, leading us to believe that the global economy is enjoying a period of sustained growth, and that the US will lead a pick-up in expansion later this year, following a near-term slowdown. The bad news? Clearly, the risk is that share prices already reflect strong earnings growth, leaving little room for disappointment.<br/>While equity markets offer an attractive prospective return relative to other asset classes, investors are best served by spreading their investment risk carefully and having realistic expectations for future returns, in our view.<br/>We expect a widening in the spread of returns among sectors and stocks, which would favour active, stock-picking managers over ‘passive’ strategies. In addition, we will continue to use option strategies to mitigate short-term risks, while maintaining cash balances a little higher than usual.<br/>How can ‘risk events’ be navigated?<br/>The coming months bring a plethora of ‘risk events’: elections in Germany and monetary- policy decisions across the globe, not to mention the ever-present potential for geopolitical flare-ups. In order to navigate them, we plan on continuing to prepare diligently ahead of political events with binary outcomes, as financial markets are often slow to appreciate the associated risks.<br/>However political events do not tend to be ‘game changers’ for markets, but they can generate more volatility than desired. And occasionally, as was the case with the Brexit vote, they can trigger material shifts in asset prices and currency markets.<br/>Even as we survey the path ahead, and seek to shift gears to fit the current investing environment, we endeavour not to focus on a single outcome – but to position for<br/>a variety of scenarios. This may dilute the spoils of victory somewhat, but should also help to safeguard against adverse market moves, in our view.<br/>For more information<br/>www.omglobalinvestors.com<br/>For investment professionals only.

OMGI 07_17_0168<br/>","34<br/>In search of rewards<br/>John Redwood | Chief Global Strategist | Charles Stanley<br/>We live in a world of low returns. If you hold cash you earn very little on your deposit. If you lend your money to an advanced country government there’s very little income paid on the government bond you buy. The main Central banks have driven the price of bonds up massively, leaving interest rates on the floor and savers scrambling to find a return.<br/>The aim of all this is to persuade people to take some more risk. There are better yields available on shares for those who can take<br/>a longer view and accept that from time to time their holdings may fall in value. There are also better incomes to be had from property. In the UK, the government has made it more difficult for the individual buy- to-let investor by increasing Stamp Duties on initial purchase, and by worsening the tax treatment of the interest on any mortgage. Meanwhile the yields on commercial property are, in most cases, more generous than bonds and many shares. Commercial property requires investment in specialist funds for most savers, or in portfolios of Real Estate Investment Trusts, given the high price of most properties.<br/>In this climate at Charles Stanley we do recommend clients to take some risk by having more in shares where they can afford to do so. We expect world stock markets<br/>to make some more upward progress, and to pay out reasonable dividends. Many companies are now generating good cash and are paying special dividends on top<br/>of their regular payouts, or are boosting share prices by buying in some of their own shares. The world is enjoying a synchronised economic recovery. The Euro area is showing modest growth, the USA is continuing its recovery, and Japan is moving forwards despite a falling and ageing population.<br/>We do not think we are near the end of<br/>this cycle. Central Banks remain broadly supportive. The Japanese Central bank wants to keep its ten-year interest rate at zero, with negative short rates. The European Central Bank is still creating money to buy up bonds, keeping rates very low. It is also encouraging improvements in weak balance sheets by commercial banks, to allow more credit to then be advanced to fuel extra growth. The Bank of England is still sticking with 0.25%<br/>as its main interest rate, and is not talking about big or sustained rises. Only the Fed is gently raising rates, but at a pace so far that the Stock market can handle. None of these institutions want to slow their economies or think there is an inflationary problem they need to control.<br/>In this climate it can also make sense for the investor to keep the costs of investing down where possible. Europe is catching<br/>up with the USA in now having a good range of Exchange Traded Funds that offer<br/>a saver exposure to a given Stock market<br/>at a low management cost. An increasing number of portfolios use these vehicles to get exposure to individual stock markets where the manager does not employ a team of expensive analysts to follow the individual shares.

There<br/>are a range of mixed funds where specialist active management is used where there is a good chance of it beating the relevant index, but index trackers are used for investment elsewhere. At Charles Stanley we do both.<br/>Some have worried that if too many shares are bought up by tracker funds this will damage the investors’ role in corporate governance. Some tracker fund management groups do now take an active interest in the companies they have to own because they are in the index, voting in favour of better governance, against excessive remuneration and on other matters that they think can help shareholder returns. They do so on<br/>the basis that they have an interest in the success of all the companies in the index. They cannot do what many active funds do, which is sell the shares when they have a disagreement with the management.<br/>In the US tracker funds have been helpful in steering more companies to better governance.<br/>Studies show that the main contributors to the performance of a portfolio are the overall decisions on how much to have in bonds or shares, and which main share markets and currencies to back within the equity portion. These decisions are not easy to get right, but you cannot duck them. There is no single index or model you can adopt for a portfolio.<br/>You do need to decide an asset allocation<br/>in the light of the client’s aims, appetite<br/>for risk, and the outlook for the markets. When it comes to buying US or European or other regional shares you do have a choice as to whether you want to spend more<br/>on trying to beat the index by selecting some shares and not others. Quite often matching the index gives you a good answer at a considerably lower price than an active solution. In practice many portfolios now use tracker etfs for some of their needs.<br/>What can go wrong for world markets? We always need to ask and to do some worrying. If the Central Banks moved too quickly to put up rates and reduce money in the system that would be bad for shares and bonds. If there were a hard landing in China or some big world crisis we have not foreseen that too could do damage. For the time being we remain optimistic, but ever vigilant.<br/>Source: IBES, MSCI, Thomson Reuters<br/>This is not personal advice based on your circumstances.

This is because, even in expansionary stages of growth, markets can be subject to losses caused by other drivers (such as geopolitics or sentiment).<br/>As a result, a well-managed fund which looks to be positioned appropriately over both tactical and strategic horizons will vary its correlation to growth-sensitive assets over time. This can be seen more clearly<br/>by looking at correlation on a rolling basis rather than the simple long-run average which will necessarily miss any steps taken to mitigate losses.<br/>Managing and evolving correlation<br/>The effect of this can be seen in Figure 2 which shows the rolling correlation between the Investec Diversified Income Fund (DIF) and<br/>the FTSE 100. The chart illustrates the severe damping of correlations between the Fund and risk assets during the Brexit event and ‘risk-off’ episodes of 2015 and 2016. Similarly, when growth assets are felt to offer unattractive reward relative to their risks (for example, if valuations are lofty against a poor technical backdrop – such as in summer and winter 2015) then correlation can be dampened down for these ‘market-risk’ based reasons. Efficient methods for controlling correlation include the sale or purchase of bond and equity futures<br/>or the use of FX hedging. This allows the risk of the Fund to be controlled across multiple frontiers but without having to change the underlying positions and in so doing miss out on their income streams.<br/>A fuller picture of behaviour<br/>The benefit of a correlation that varies over time can be an improvement in the skew of returns a strategy produces which is perhaps the most important measure of its attractiveness.

All 3 funds have delivered performances that compare favourably to the Mixed investment sector averages – but without the distraction of the peaks and troughs arising from changing market sentiments.<br/>Unique smoothing process:<br/>The smoothing process is transparent and aims<br/>to reduce the impacts of market volatility.<br/>Money is initially invested into the funds at the underlying unit price and the investment is valued at the underlying price for the first 26 weeks. Thereafter, the fund values are smoothed by using a mechanism that takes the average of the fund’s daily underlying price over the preceding 26 weeks to calculate an averaged price. After the first 26 weeks the investment will normally be valued at the averaged price.<br/>The 2nd chart illustrates the impact of the smoothing process on the volatility of the funds compared to funds with similar asset allocations. Past performance is not a reliable guide to future returns.<br/>Flexible Guarantees:<br/>While the unique smoothing process provides a welcome shock-absorber against short-term market volatility, the LV= funds also offer the additional security of a capital guarantee that can be purchased at any time – not just at the outset. The guarantee applies to the value at the end of the selected guarantee period and the value of the fund may be less – or more – if it is moved or cashed in early. For extra flexibility the guarantee can be also be switched off at any time. This ability to start, alter or renew the guarantees, effectively creates a ‘lock in’ feature which can act as a defence mechanism to protect gains achieved and/or to remove the risk of investment loss..

So the quote<br/>you receive is based on your client being perfectly healthy.<br/>Some online services do ask a few underwriting questions, but the journeys are developed with the view that advisers and customers do not have much time and want a quick answer. Therefore, the quote you receive includes a caveat - subject to underwriting.<br/>“Mild impairments” may produce a binding quote (no need for medical evidence). However, for a client with high BMI and multiple health issues such as diabetes, this will require manual intervention from an underwriter.<br/>The journey differs from insurer to insurer. Behind the scenes the big life offices assess their risk appetite on a daily basis, based<br/>upon analysis of thousands of pieces of management information.<br/>So achieving a consistency of decision across all life offices is difficult. Some specialist advisers build up knowledge of an insurer’s stance through regular telephone calls to underwriting departments. This isn’t always consistent as one underwriter has a different view to another, and this can be the same with reinsurers.<br/>Underwriting for poor health, it would seem, is a science.<br/>That’s why we specialise in underwriting life cover for those in poor health.<br/>• Our experience of underwriting impaired lives means we can provide cover for some of those people with medical conditions who may previously have been considered uninsurable .<br/>• Each case is looked at individually. This<br/>is what you would expect for a client with health issues, as online underwriting engines would not be able to cope with more complicated medical history.<br/>• Our products are straightforward with no bells and whistles keeping the premiums down.<br/>• We now offer terms for poor health, not just declined applications from other life offices. So we are no longer a last resort.<br/>• We can keep premiums affordable by calculating a sum assured to a client’s suggested premium.<br/>• We offer technical trust help for business protection requests.<br/>• We offer personal assistance for more difficult cases.<br/>EXAMPLE CASE STUDY FOR SHAREHOLDER PROTECTION<br/>Andrew Smith, 57, is a business man. He’s one of three directors of a packaging company.<br/>At a review meeting with his adviser, it was explained that key person cover would not be enough to prevent the company having financial difficulties, if one of the directors, who each own 33% of the share capital, were to die.<br/>XYZ packaging is not a family business. Should either director fall seriously ill or die, this is likely to cause significant disruption and problems, to both the business and the family of the owner.<br/>","Mr Phillips obtains life cover in an individual Business Trust for £100,000 with the beneficiaries being Mr Smith and Mr James.<br/>41<br/>Mr Smith obtains life cover in an individual Business Trust for £100,000 with the beneficiaries being Mr James and Mr Phillips.<br/>Mr James obtains life cover in an individual Business Trust for £100,000 with the beneficiaries being Mr Smith and Mr Phillips.<br/>A Cross Options Agreement is set up.<br/>For illustration purposes Mr Smith dies.<br/>Mr Smith’s shares are paid to his estate.<br/>The life cover pays out £100,000 to the beneficiaries (Mr James and Mr Phillips).<br/>Mr James and Mr Phillips use the proceeds of the life cover to buy Mr Smith’s shares from his estate.<br/>The purchased shares are then divided equally between Mr James and<br/>Mr Phillips.<br/>If Andrew Smith was to die, his share of the business would automatically be owned by his spouse and she would then have an interest in the company.<br/>In most cases it will be a requirement that the business continues under the ownership of the surviving owners and the family/dependants of the deceased receive appropriate financial compensation. If all the business owners were members of the same family, for example, parents and children, then there would be<br/>no problem with succession when one of<br/>the business owners dies. The other family members would probably take over, with the family usually looking after the dependants of the deceased owner.<br/>To fund for purchase on death, ordinary life assurance will usually be appropriate.<br/>Unfortunately, Andrew has been declined by ABC life assurance because of heart problems:<br/>• Hypertension<br/>• High Cholesterol<br/>• A stent fitted 5 years ago<br/>This is where we can help. Our expertise in poor health means that Andrew could be covered alongside his healthy directors.<br/>To make sure the funds for purchase are available in the right hands at the right time, it’s necessary to use an appropriate Trust. For business succession cases a “Business Trust” will be suitable along with a cross option agreement*.<br/>• Each shareholder (the directors) takes out life cover held in an individual Business Trust equal to the value of their shareholding (£100,000). In their Trust the appointed beneficiaries are the other two shareholders.<br/>• A Cross Option Agreement* is set up to allow each shareholder the option to purchase, in the event of death, the deceased’s equity.<br/>• In the event of death of one of the shareholders, the beneficiaries of the life cover (£100,000), pay the proceeds to the estate to buy the deceased’s equity.<br/>• The purchased shares are then divided equally between the two surviving shareholders.<br/>*A cross option agreement can also be known as the double option or put and call agreement. As the preferred vehicle for shareholder protection insurance, the cross option agreement provides the surviving shareholders with the option to buy the deceased business owners share of the business.<br/>Just offers a number of business protection products including Relevant Life, Key Person Protection, Commercial Loan/Mortgage Protection, along with Shareholder Protection.<br/>For more information go to - www.justadviser.com/products/life-assurance/<br/>","42<br/>Commercial interests<br/>Nigel Ashfield | Managing Director and Partner | TIME Investments<br/>An investor looking for a steady income stream 10 years ago could have invested in UK Government bonds and been rewarded with around 5%. Today that reward amounts to just 1%.<br/>Once rising inflation is taken into account the picture looks even starker. The retail price index (RPI) stands at 3.6%, currently meaning investors in so-called safe haven bonds are looking at a negative return.<br/>For nearly 10 years since the global financial crisis hit in 2008, the return from UK Government bonds has reached record low after record low as the Bank of England attempted to limit some of the damage.<br/>These crippling low interest rates are made yet worse by the recent return of rising inflation.<br/>At the same time, individuals are expected to take more personal responsibility for securing their financial futures, particularly in retirement.<br/>Defined contribution pension scheme members were granted the freedom to invest their pension pots with impunity from age 55, creating a wealth of opportunity to grow retirement savings long into the future. Yet, just as investment freedom expands so the availability of appropriate income streams contracts.<br/>So for investors grappling with the income trap it may be time to look beyond traditional asset classes.<br/>The long game<br/>Long income commercial property offers the potential to deliver stable income over the long term without the volatility associated with traditional real estate investment.<br/>Long income property funds investing<br/>in commercial freeholds have long been available to large institutional investors, such as pension funds and insurance companies. Now these tried and tested funds are coming to the retail market via FCA authorised funds.<br/>The mechanics of long income commercial property funds are quite simple; they invest in commercial freeholds with long leases and ground rent agreements.<br/>Freehold properties with ground rents are let to commercial tenants at around 15% to 40% of the going market rate for the building, for terms in excess of 60 years.<br/>This provides stability of income for the freeholder and incentivises the tenant<br/>to maintain their ground rent payments, since failure to do so would mean giving up extremely attractive rent payments.<br/>And because the property’s market value can be worth as much as four times the underlying freehold, these properties are often over-collateralised offering additional protection to investors.<br/>Commercial freeholds with long leases are UK properties let to tenants for periods<br/>of typically over 20 years and tend to offer a higher income return compared to commercial freeholds with ground rents.<br/>With both long leases and ground rents, rent reviews are typically linked to inflation and agreed at outset rather than subject<br/>to negotiations as is usually the case<br/>with traditional rental agreements over commercial property.

The answer is simple. When it comes to investing, most people,<br/>most of the time, will be significantly better off with the support of a<br/>financial adviser.<br/>Let’s think for a moment about the financial challenges facing many of us in the United Kingdom. Increasingly, individuals and families are expected to take direct responsibility<br/>for life’s largest expenses, a home, higher education and support in later life.<br/>These are real challenges but we should not feel overwhelmed.<br/>At Vanguard, we believe in the power of investment as a means to meet life’s financial challenges. Like any powerful resource, the more it is harnessed and directed, the more benefits it can bring. And that is the role of a financial adviser. Ideally, an adviser will help not just with your personal plans but with those of your family, including passing wealth to the next generations, business issues, estate planning and the like.<br/>Vanguard has done a lot of research on how advisers bring value to their clients. I would like to share some of those insights, which might help you to make the most of your adviser.<br/>Set the strategy<br/>The first step in establishing a good investment strategy is to clarify what it is you need to achieve. Your adviser can help you<br/>to analyse your present financial situation as<br/>By balancing out your current and prospective resources, your estimated required return<br/>and your willingness to put your capital at risk, an adviser can construct a portfolio of investments that is right for you. This process,<br/>By balancing out your current and prospective resources, your estimated required return<br/>and your willingness to put your capital at risk, an adviser can construct a portfolio of investments that is right for you.<br/>well as your future prospects.

Whether it is a bespoke portfolio or a simple, all-in-one solution, it is ultimately the mix of investments that most determines whether you meet your objectives.<br/>","45<br/>We believe in the power of investment as a means to meet life’s financial challenges. Like any powerful resource, the more it is harnessed and directed, the more benefits it can bring.<br/>Minimise costs<br/>Investment charges can eat significantly into investor returns over the longer term. But research shows that few investors know how much they are paying and a surprising number believe they are not paying anything at all.<br/>There are many reasons for this. On an annual basis, charges look small. It is only when they are compounded out over many years that the damage will be done. On top of that,<br/>they can be complex, covering a number of separate services, such as fund management, account management, audit, custody, trusteeship and so on. Different investment firms will charge for different services in different ways. Then there are add-ons that may or may not be charged, depending on various terms and conditions, such as initial charges, dilution levies and exit charges.<br/>Understanding charges and ensuring they are minimised to the benefit of the investor is another critical value that an adviser offers.<br/>Keeping a balance<br/>The long-term nature of investment presents the problem of how to manage<br/>a portfolio through a number of changing economic and business cycles. We need only think of what has gone on over<br/>the past 20 years to appreciate how dramatically conditions can shift: the tech<br/>boom and bust, the emerging market rally, the housing boom, the financial crisis and the subsequent recovery interspersed with episodic crisis in the euro area.<br/>A good financial adviser is there to ensure that through all of these changing times, your portfolio is kept in balance and aligned with your circumstances and your goals. Personal circumstances can also change, and a good adviser, who has taken the time to get to know your goals for you and your family, will be able to advise on the best course to ensure your investments can adapt as needed.<br/>When times are calm, this may seem a fairly obvious function. But it can matter hugely when the market is falling, when there is catastrophe in the headlines, or indeed, when markets are soaring and profits look all too easy. At such times, whether from fear or greed, we are all tempted to give in to emotion, or act on our intuition, and it’s then that sensible counsel is most valuable<br/>Tax efficiency<br/>Finally, there is tax. Taxes differ as they relate to different types of assets, to income and capital, to inheritance or gifts or trusts, and whether you invest directly or through an Individual Savings Account or through one of the other many vehicles for saving for a pension.<br/>An adviser can take your complete circumstances into account and help you<br/>to structure your investments in a manner that can minimise your tax liabilities. This process should evolve through varying life phases, from when you are accumulating assets to when you need to access them (either as capital sums or as income) through transferring them to family members.<br/>Longer, healthier lives are wonderful blessings, as are educational opportunities and the chance of a nice home. But nothing comes free.

We use this concept in an effort to get a well-diversified portfolio, as investing across the well-known asset classes is the best way to manage risk and return.<br/>But how does the theory hold up in different times, and how has the approach taken by managers evolved over the last 60 years?<br/>One reason there are few great investors<br/>is the complex nature of the subject with<br/>no guarantees. Approaches that seem to be delivering results for a time can often be<br/>found to have been suited by one particular investment style factor, which when it goes out of fashion leaves its investors disappointed.<br/>Success as an investor requires perceptive thinking and recognition that it is not always possible to have an edge for outperformance in all market conditions. Most investors recognise<br/>that extraordinary performance only comes from correct non-consensus forecasts, but they may not recognise that these by their nature are hard to make consistently. For an investor to achieve superior results there is a need for non-consensus views regarding value. Furthermore, these need to be accurate; over time an investor needs to get more right than wrong.<br/>Chance or skill?<br/>It is important to remember that one or two good years prove nothing, as chance alone can produce just about any result. Someone in a casino making five consecutive winning bets on the roulette table hasn’t demonstrated skill, and in investments the same is true.<br/>True manager skill can only start to be ascertained over a minimum of five years (market cycle), and ideally over longer time periods. Most asset classes are quite efficient, though of course this does vary depending on how well researched they are. The better an asset class is known and the broader its following, the harder it is to make a non- consensus winning bet against the herd. In<br/>some mainstream markets it can be argued<br/>it is almost a waste of time to try and find winners, certainly without a specialised approach. Investors are more likely to find superior returns investing in inefficient markets.<br/>Investment styles<br/>Finding inefficiency can be approached in different ways with investors very often described as either value or growth style oriented.Value investors look to buy businesses at a significant discount to their intrinsic value, while growth investors look to find businesses that will continue to grow faster and for longer than the market expects. Other investors try and combine bits of both these approaches. Many value investors rely on mean reversion, both for shares and company profitability<br/>or even economies. Even this long-standing approach has come into question where markets have been distorted by QE and traditional businesses have suffered disruption, while others with monopoly powers have hung on to super-high levels of margins with little sign that these are being competed away.<br/>","47<br/>Success as an investor requires perceptive thinking and recognition that it is not always possible to have an edge for outperformance in all market conditions.<br/>For investors wanting a lower risk approach, finding a manager who is rigorous on both quality factors and the price paid in absolute terms can deliver results with lower than market volatility, in part simply by avoiding big mistakes. Investment approaches favouring quality at any price, or value at any quality, may deliver results over short time periods, but there are likely to be occasional periods of blow ups or disappointment.<br/>Forced sellers<br/>One important thing for investors to remember is that as well as buying at the right price, it is important to sell at the right price, and certainly not to be forced to dump an asset well below its intrinsic value. Never being a forced seller of an illiquid asset is<br/>an important mantra for every investor to remember.<br/>Risk vs return<br/>To make above-average returns over the risk- free rate, taking risk is inescapable. This involves understanding risk and also trying to work<br/>out when it may be high. Investors can also control risk through portfolio construction. This may initially involve deciding whether a given investment justifies the risk, that is, thinking about the risk-adjusted return.<br/>Many investors define risk as volatility although some would argue a better definition of risk is absolute loss of the capital invested.<br/>The risk of permanent loss is the biggest one an investor should worry about.<br/>Central bank policy today with zero or negative interest rates has encouraged many investors to make riskier investments than are actually suitable for their own personal objectives. As Warren Buffett has stated “it’s only when the tide goes out that you find out who’s been swimming naked”.<br/>In today’s world of low rates, risk avoidance will probably result in very low returns, but understanding and controlling the risk taken is more important than ever before. For long- term investment avoiding losers is just as important as finding winners.<br/>Within equity markets it is not changes in earnings that drive the largest profit or loss, but actually changing valuation, driven by investor psychology, and this psychology swings back and forth like a pendulum. Investors entering the market from mid- 2009 through 2010 were buying at a time when the pendulum had swung to extremely pessimistic levels which is why the returns have been so strong since then.<br/>It is also necessary to understand investor psychology or behavioural finance aspects when constructing a portfolio. Investors<br/>need patience as market valuations tend to overshoot on both the upside and downside, so for a while an investor will look wrong and, possibly to friends and colleagues, stupid. Most<br/>investors are trend followers, whereas the most successful investors have done the exact opposite. Always remember that at the most extreme point in markets most investors, and therefore the conventional wisdom of the day, will be wrong.<br/>In any form of forecasting, whether it is stock markets or the weather, there is a tendency to extrapolate the recent past into the future. This can work for a time, but will miss turning points and this is when large amounts of money can either be lost or opportunities missed to make significant returns - and unlike in sport, it is possible to win in investment simply by making fewer mistakes than the average.<br/>This is an extract from our white paper ‘Understanding Markets and Risk July 2017 - Thoughts on Portfolio Construction’ written by RSMR Investment Director Graham O’Neill.

We look at how you can prepare for the changes and avoid the pitfalls.<br/>The personal data that companies hold on their systems, whether paper-based or digital, client or employee personal data, will fall under GDPR. Information security, governance and data privacy will be areas under scrutiny with the new legislation. The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) details 12 steps to take now in preparation for the impending changes1:<br/>1. Awareness<br/>Ensuring key people within the organisation are aware of the implications GDPR is likely to have on business practices.<br/>2. Information you hold<br/>Ensuring personal information you hold can be evidenced, including how it was obtained and who you share it with. Information audit may be needed.<br/>3. Communicating privacy information<br/>All privacy notices should be reviewed and any necessary changes planned in, prior to May 2018.<br/>4. Individuals’ rights<br/>The new legislation expands individuals’ rights and it will likely impact business procedures. Ensure that you are covering all the new rights including how you would delete personal data from your systems as well as providing data in an electronic and commonly used format.<br/>5. Subject access requests<br/>The timescales and content of subject access request are changing so you should update any business procedures and plan how to handle the request within the new framework.<br/>6. Lawful basis for processing personal data<br/>Identify the legal basis for your processing activity, document it and explain it in your privacy notices.<br/>7. Consent<br/>The GDPR sets higher standards on<br/>seeking, recording and managing consent,<br/>so you should check how you currently capture consent to see if you need to make any changes.<br/>8. Children<br/>If you store or process any personal data relating to a minor, you need to ensure that you have systems in place for verifying their age<br/>as well as how to obtain parental or guardian consent for any data processing activity.<br/>9. Data breaches<br/>Data breaches notification period will reduce to 72 hours and you need to ensure that you have the procedures in place to be able to detect, report and investigate a personal data breach.<br/>10. Data protection by design and protection impact assessment<br/>Refer to the ICO’s code of practice on Privacy Impact Assessments and determine how and when to implement them in your organisation.<br/>11. Data protection officers<br/>Data protection compliance and responsibility should be built into a designated role within the company and consideration given whether your organisation is required to appoint a data protection officer.<br/>","49<br/>The personal data that companies hold on their systems, whether paper-based or digital, client or employee personal data, will fall under GDPR. Information security, governance and data privacy will be areas under scrutiny with the new legislation.<br/>12. International<br/>If you carry out cross-border processing operating in more than one EU member state, determine your lead data protection supervisory authority. Refer to the Article 29 Working Party guidelines which will help with this.<br/>Where to start?<br/>The Data Protection Act (DPA) 1998 already has detailed processes in place on how to protect individuals’ personal data. The DPA enforces firms to have proper controls in place ensuring personal information is handled<br/>fairly including helping clients to understand who is responsible for handling their personal information, what it will be used for and any other information needed such as who will be processing the information on the firm’s behalf.<br/>Good practice recommendations from the ICO aimed at financial advisers currently state to2:<br/>• Make sure employees are clear about what they can and cannot do with personal information and who it can be disclosed to<br/>• Make sure employees are clear what use they can make of personal information in the event they leave the firm<br/>• Make sure customers know whose client they are, what their information will be used for and to whom it may be disclosed to<br/>The list of recommendations is likely to expand to cover GDPR specific additions, therefore a good starting point towards GDPR compliance is the ‘Getting ready for the GDPR’ data protection self-assessment toolkit3 from the ICO. This assessment will allow you to select the readiness level for your firm and gives<br/>you a list of recommendations to follow up to ensure you are on your way to compliance with comprehensive but proportionate governance measures by May 2018.<br/>Data Information Registers<br/>One of the main areas of GDPR is a firm’s understanding of the data they hold and for what reasons. Data information registers are required to evidence the understanding of<br/>the personal information. Depending on the size and complexity of the firm, these can be in-house developed registers, or for ease of use and efficiency, a software tool can be used to manage the different data sets which all firms are likely to have, including employee, client and partner data.<br/>Synaptic Software has teamed up with the UK’s leading legal software provider, Eclipse, and together we provide a Data Asset Register tool, which is easy to use and can provide evidence to the ICO, should it be required,<br/>on what data is kept, where, who can access it and the retention periods amongst other requirements. Should you wish to learn more,<br/>contact our relationship team either by email sales@synaptic.co.uk or call 0800 783 4477.<br/>There is no time to delay – GDPR will be enforcable by May 2018 and good data protection practice will enhance your business value as well as ensure compliancy and avoid any potential enforcement actions.<br/>Synaptic Software – Readiness Programme for GDPR<br/>As your technology partner, Synaptic Software is committed to GDPR compliance across our cloud and on- premise services.

Not so much because of the topic – although this does contain views that will displease some – but because of print deadlines meaning significant things could have changed between my writing of this on a pleasant summer evening and your reading as leaves start to change colour.<br/>The long term forecast is that the relative cool of the Protection landscape this autumn will be warmed by heated discussion around the future of critical illness products prompted by the ABI’s critical illness (CI) Statement of Best Practice (SoBP).<br/>The ABI produces this SoBP every three years. I chaired the last one and am a<br/>very interested observer of this year’s. The aim of this work is to produce a common market standard of a basic CI product and the terms used to describe it. It intends to ensure an effective market can operate with an understanding of the similarities and differences between products.<br/>The 2014 SoBP three years ago was (in<br/>part fortunately and in part deliberately) a reasonably quiet affair. We distinguished and defined additional and partial payments, acknowledged the existence of ‘ABI+’ definitions and assigned a standard to these,<br/>and slightly amended some definitions to meet changing market and medical practice. We didn’t go round in circles about TPD (Total Permanent Disability), add loads of definitions or take a deep cut to the basic coverage offered.<br/>Reflecting on the experience, the initial meetings can be amazingly anecdotal. On<br/>a human level it’s quite refreshing that in a world of actuaries, doctors and underwriters, many of the first insights are personal frustration where people have felt the coverage “does not do what it set out to do”. At times this felt like the people who set out the rules of the game were complaining about the outcome.<br/>That experience led to an early sense of foreboding whenever the great and the good start explaining what “the product set out to do”. This seems to become one of those great campfire stories about times of yore,<br/>which all choose to sculpt to their own views while reminiscing: “Aaagh, Old Chief he tell me Silent Heart Attack would never a CI definition make”.<br/>Common themes from these fables tend to be that:<br/>• someone must suffer before we give them<br/>money<br/>• technological advances may bring the end<br/>of the critical illness world<br/>• we must all keep flying to the bright,<br/>beautiful CI light<br/>So what about this time?<br/>It is expected that there will be more fundamental changes as a result of this SoBP. There are some good reasons for this - there are incrementally clearer threats to the traditional CI model now than there were three years ago.<br/>","53<br/>I would urge all with an interest in the CI market to engage with the SoBP when the opportunity arises, the really interesting work will come after as we see the real motivation for some of the changes coming through.<br/>The diagnosis of many of the lower impact critical illnesses continues to increase, and the prognosis for these continues to improve. These two levers mean that left unchanged, while the impact of suffering an insured condition is decreasing, the cost of the cover would have to increase.<br/>Furthermore, there are justifiably different approaches being taken by different insurers<br/>to the grouping of conditions being developed. Should we define dementia in one definition or four? Should we adopt the same approach to other conditions like heart conditions?<br/>To get (even more) technical - the SoBP guidance to date has said that if 75% of the market has the same definition heading,<br/>there should be an agreed ABI wording. If<br/>half the market are splitting out definitions to maximise the number of conditions covered, and the other half are putting together to try and simplify the appearance of the product, it is difficult to maintain this approach. The most pragmatic approach may now be to retreat<br/>to base camp – and just define the conditions at the very centre of the CI product (those causing over 80% of claims) and leave the market to do their best on the rest.<br/>The future of CI<br/>I believe better products would have developed than the current form of critical illness if we didn’t have ABI industry wordings. The ABI wordings have such a strong gravitational pull, you need to develop something in another galaxy or you get sucked into the CI orbit. Many have listened to what people really<br/>want and built something based on impact and need, but found themselves burning up in the heat of contact with sales and marketing teams with the power of “numbers of conditions” and “ABI+ conditions”.<br/>Whilst some products more directly linking the impact of the illness to the financial support given might have grown without the ABI approach, I recognise the market would have been even tougher to navigate as a consumer or adviser. Therefore, it seems quite likely that fewer products would have been sold. This seems a case where a good outcome for many trumps a better for one for fewer.<br/>In this context, a retreat to fewer defined conditions may give the market the breathing space to create comparable but distinct products at last.<br/>Ultimately the ABI SoBP does need to ensure that the basic product it defines is insurable – but I do not believe it should be influencing the market beyond that.<br/>There are times when companies recognise that setting the “standard” cover at a deliberately cautious level allows them to take credit for doing something above the industry standard before the ink is even dry on the document. Therefore, while I would urge all with an interest in the CI market to engage with the SoBP when the opportunity arises, the really interesting work will come after as we see the real motivation for some of the changes coming through.<br/>I hope this will mean new products with simple claim triggers clearly linked partially<br/>to diagnosis and partially to observed impact. Others will have different ideas – and so long as some resonate with customers we should have an exciting marketplace to improve our ability to help people when they really need it.<br/>COVER ME NOW<br/>","54<br/>COVER ME NOW<br/>Cover Me Now Protection Portal now combines ‘Buy It Now’ Protection with full range of provider options<br/>Synaptic Software Limited<br/>Ahead of other portals looking to create Buy it Now solutions, Synaptic Software have produced a template for the sale of Protection in the future, offering a genuine option to Buy-it-now with a guaranteed premium and immediate cover.<br/>Synaptic Webline technology has traditionally been preferred by the large volume Protection writers.
