Now you can harness the power of Synaptic Webline and remove the obstacles in the sales process.”<br/>Adam Byford, Managing Director, Synaptic Software Limited<br/>administrational activity customers and advisers alike go through to put protection in place.<br/>much but it does need clients to answer ‘no’ to all of the medical questions presented<br/>to them on-screen to benefit from the immediate policy commencement and guaranteed fixed premium. A ‘yes’ to any medical question will immediately remove them from the Cover Me Now process. However, all is not lost, as premiums from existing Webline providers will be returned and you and your client can then continue along the current Webline journey.<br/>Once the policy is live, policy documentation will be sent directly to your client by the insurance provider.<br/>Customer interaction and feedback is<br/>pivotal in understanding their purchasing behaviour, so providing not only a simplified solution but life cover on a guaranteed<br/>issue basis, we are allowing you to reach<br/>out to all types of customer – Millennials and the more digitally-savvy Baby<br/>Boomers - who will surely appreciate the accelerated underwriting process and easy-to-understand life cover. To build<br/>upon the simplicity angle, we have also considered additional features that will<br/>aid the streamlined approach and your connection with your client, such as an integrated address look-up and bank account validation service. Most online purchases still involve an element of mailing and speaking<br/>to an insurance company operative in some way during the process, but Cover Me Now removes those aspects offering a very light touch process for the adviser and customer – quote to policy in as little as 15 minutes!<br/>This proposition is also flexible enough for another provider or distributor to adopt and white-labelled versions of Cover Me Now will be available at launch to two other leading online brokers, extending the reach to more of the protection market.<br/>Not a bad find as a result of a personal dating ad!<br/>Adam Byford, Managing Director of Synaptic Software, said “The industry was desperate for a breakthrough from the old and failing ways of selling protection.

Put simply, you’ll be able to obtain a level or decreasing term quotation (up to a maximum cover amount of £500,000) with an immediate start<br/>date on a guaranteed priced basis.

Tightly holding onto those traditional application form questions as we enter the scary Digital Sea. Trembling fingers grasping for the soothing familiarity of critical illness conditions as<br/>we’re battered by star ratings and comparison websites.<br/>When we apply underwriting ratings we search for the familiar islands of +50, +75, +100 rather than dare to believe there may be some rocky outcrops connecting these foreign shores.<br/>It is time to accept that there is not going to be a heroic rescue. There will be no helicopters flown in by bright shiny start-ups to sweep us off to a comfortable new paradise. We need to patch things together and work together to make things better.<br/>As bedraggled survivors we need to piece together what it is that we each know stripped back to that basic state. Every bit of information we have is precious.<br/>Things that in times of plenty we could afford to toss away may now hold the key to our future. By carefully piecing it all together we could make something that offers a way out of here.<br/>It may well be that not everyone will survive. Those who do not work with others will go under unless they are incredibly strong or smart. Those who do not have a reason for others to work with them will struggle alone and adrift.<br/>After the storm people may come together in very different ways. The traditional UK protection model that has overseen our shrinking market operates as:<br/>• Reinsurers (taking 90%+ of the claims risk, the ultimate sign off for products, underwriting and claims)<br/>• Insurers (doing the operational work in accepting risks, paying claims and marketing products)<br/>• Distributors (doing the actual advising,<br/>sales, marketing and explaining to the customer)<br/>• IT Portals (bringing the relevant information from one group to another)<br/>• Data specialists (providing lead or risk information to others)<br/>• Customer (the most important yet least understood)<br/>All know things that others in the process do not know. All know things that they do not currently share with others in the process. Now is the time to consider if there are things that you know that would help make the process, price or product better if you were able to share it with another.<br/>Are you using all of the knowledge you have to its maximum potential?

Easier than you think?<br/>Ian Smart | Product Architect | Royal London<br/>Protection providers often extol the benefits of placing plans in trust. The advantages for clients are widely recognised and numerous – inheritance tax mitigation, avoiding probate delay, controlling claim proceeds, and so the long, familiar list continues.<br/>Yet, dismissed as unnecessary form-filling, or simply viewed as irrelevant in the context of a mortgage sale, less than 5% of our personal protection plans are written in trust.<br/>Many providers are committed to making the trusts process as straightforward as possible for adviser and client alike, by simplifying trust forms wherever possible and producing easy to follow guidance literature. Nevertheless, placing a plan in trust will always involve a little more effort on the part of the adviser than not doing so.<br/>But there is a growing trend for providers to make this process even easier with the use of online trusts. Several providers offer this in slightly different guises but this is generally in the form of a trust request rather than<br/>a formal deed. This involves the customer making a declaration to their adviser that they want their policy to be written under trust. The adviser then completes the details of<br/>any trustees and/or beneficiaries online and submits the form to the insurance company. Once complete, copies will be sent to the client and their trustees, and no signatures are generally required. The main drawback<br/>is that this process is only available for new applications and it must be completed before the policy starts in order for the trust to be valid. You’re also never quite sure whether the trustees have accepted their appointment and are willing to act when the time comes.<br/>But wouldn’t it be good if online trusts could<br/>be offered for existing plans as well? Well the truth is they can, as long as an appropriate process is used. Royal London is the first provider to introduce this facility for our most frequently used trusts. Other trusts and the deeds used to amend them will follow in due course to allow you to make the most of the trusts we have available.<br/>Placing a plan in trust will always involve a little more effort on the part of the adviser than not doing so.<br/>","9<br/>Wouldn’t it be good if online trusts could be offered for existing plans as well? Well the truth is they can, as long as an appropriate process is used. Royal London is the first provider to introduce this facility for our most frequently used trusts.<br/>The process is a little more involved than<br/>a trust request and, just like a paper form, requires a signature from each of the client, a witness and the trustees in order for a valid deed to be created. But by using electronic signatures the time taken and effort needed to complete the form can be significantly reduced in comparison to a paper form.<br/>As long as you have up to date email addresses and mobile numbers for each client and their trustees, the process allows all parties to sign within minutes of each other, even if they are hundreds of miles apart, and removes the risk of the form getting ‘lost in the post’. The guided process ensures that essential parts of the form cannot be left incomplete, and the process also ensures that people cannot sign in the wrong order, both of which are common reasons for paper forms being returned for amendment. We’ll even notify you when the form is complete so that you can download a copy of the form for your own records.<br/>This process can be used with new applications as well as policies that are already in force. So, as an adviser, you are in control<br/>and can choose when in the sales process you want to introduce the concept of using a trust. This means that for policies like Relevant life or business protection (where it is essential the trust is in place before the policy starts), you can do this at the same time as the<br/>online application. But for personal or family protection, whilst it may be good practice, there isn’t the same need to set the trust<br/>up immediately, it can be done at a time that suits both you and the client without disturbing the sales process.<br/>The process is exactly the same irrespective of whether it is a new application or the policy<br/>is already in force. It also means that you<br/>can revisit any plans sold previously where the client never got round to completing the<br/>paper form and add the trust now. Perhaps you have clients coming up for an annual review where their policy wasn’t previously written in trust. This new facility allows you to do this quickly and simply.<br/>So the next time you’re submitting a new application to Royal London or reviewing<br/>the cover one of your client’s has with Royal London why not take a look at our new online trust service. If you do, please let us know what you think of it. We are keen to get as much feedback as possible so that we can develop the service in a way that adds value to you and your customers.<br/>This is a Royal London promotion.<br/>As an adviser, you are in control and can choose when in the sales process you want to introduce the concept of using a trust.<br/>","10<br/>The devil is in the detail<br/>Mark Polson | Founder | the lang cat<br/>Well hello again. After an issue ‘resting’, it’s nice to be back writing for Synaptic. We’re into 2017 now – don’t know if you noticed – and as I write this it appears that the world is going to hell in an orange- skinned, floppy-haired, small-handed cart.<br/>It’s particularly ironic, then, that I think<br/>the intermediary market and by extension platforms and asset managers are having one of the strongest starts to a year for some time. Certainly the bloodbath of Q1 2016 seems to be a distant memory, with one platform reporting to us that their January is 60% up on last year. Others have to make do with 15% or 20%; but it’s all good.<br/>I don’t know about you, but I sense a bit more optimism this year (apart from the impending nuclear winter, of course). Advisers we speak to have never been busier.<br/>Platform and provider proposition teams have a slug of budget to play with and are having a bit of fun (unless you work for a provider with a big integration project on the go; hello Standard! Hello Aegon!). Even firms such as Ascentric and Alliance Trust Savings, who are in the midst of re-platforming, have a bit of a spring in their collective steps.<br/>When we get energy like this in the room, you have to be careful not to get any on your jacket. No, that’s not right. You have to be careful to direct it properly, otherwise it can make a bit of a mess.<br/>Here’s an example. It won’t come as a surprise to anyone reading this that advisers would generally like more integration between their CRM or back office system and the platforms that they use. We conducted<br/>a bit of research on this recently and along with ‘just make the bloody thing work’ this was one of the key bits of feedback we heard. With respect to our hosts, probably the<br/>best instance of integration we’ve seen for a while is between the Best Practice network’s SEI-powered Fusion Wealth platform and its proprietary back office system, Enable. One user waxed lyrical to us about how there were certain points in the system which allowed you to jump seamlessly from back office to platform and back again, with real- time 2-way information updating.<br/>But when you talk to proposition teams, much of the planning at the moment<br/>is around being able to maintain model portfolios in the back office, or fire trades from there (this is already available in some<br/>It won’t come to a surprise to anyone reading this that advisers would generally like more integration between their CRM or back office system and the platforms that they use.<br/>","11<br/>It’s particularly ironic, then, that I think the intermediary market and by extension platforms and asset managers are having one of the strongest starts to a year for some time.<br/>cases). I always thought that this would be hugely popular with advisers – in fact our most recent work suggests no appetite at all. Advisers and planners simply don’t trust the quality of the integration; they want<br/>to know exactly who to shout at when things go wrong. One firm we talked to even resists existing ‘lightning strike’ data transfer between his back office and his platform, preferring to re-key. His rationale? If it goes wrong, he knows it’s his fault and can put it right.<br/>In this environment, it’s easy to forget the basics. You ready? Listen to the users. That’s all you need to remember.<br/>It’s tough to do. Everything is so complex nowadays (also, chocolate bars are getting smaller). Everything is detail, mainly because just about everything works pretty well<br/>in most cases most of the time. You can<br/>see it in cars, in mobile phones, in washing machines, in TVs. You can see it in platforms and back office systems. Soon enough you’ll start seeing it in life companies and SIPPcos.<br/>What I’m talking about is a mismatch between what advisers care about and what people in charge of the propositions themselves care about. One adviser firm practice manager put it brilliantly to us:<br/>“I was trying to get together a matrix of features, but it’s not very straightforward<br/>because they all do similar things in similar ways. You have to get too granular to show the design flaws, but it’s the granular stuff that breaks the system.”<br/>Isn’t that perfect? It’s the encapsulation of just about everything I’ve heard in 20-something years in this industry.<br/>But sorting minutiae is not interesting to proposition teams, who get the heroic bonuses (actually not that heroic; generally 20% of basic salary or maybe up to 40% if they’re lucky) for delivering big ticket items which will allow the platform to fish deeply in new limpid, well-stocked value pools. That is to say, no-one gets rewarded for slightly happier adviser administrators.<br/>That feels like a shame.<br/>Another firm we spoke to has got its platform selection pretty much locked in on the basis that they are ‘virtually error-free’. Let’s unpack that a little. This firm – who are really awesome financial planners – use who they use not because it’s great, or innovative, or offers a great user experience to clients, or beautiful reports, or low prices. No, they are loyal users of two platforms who manage to do their jobs tolerably well, most of the time.<br/>You want an indictment of how things are working as we come into 2017? There it is, right there. And if proposition teams<br/>are suffering from a surfeit of rising-sap, this is where they might spend some time. Advisers reading this – what you need to do is make the senior execs of the platforms and CRMs you use sit still and listen to your administrators.<br/>We wrote in our last advised platform guide that we remained saddened that platforms hadn’t moved on and that experiences were still much as they’d been in 2015 when we had fun by pronouncing that ‘platforms are dead’. We’re hopeful to see a phoenix-like platform bird type thing rising from the ashes. It seems inconceivable to me that a market that moves this fast can be moribund for so long, without anyone really coming in to disturb it.<br/>But all that high level stuff is for another day. For now, let’s make 2017 a year of nuance. We don’t need big headlines; we don’t need one-dimensional ways of assessing platforms or anything else. There’s a lot going on. Everything is complex now; and complexity need not be a vice if you’ve got the skills<br/>to deal with it. Happily for hundreds of thousands of clients, advisers do. I hope we can preserve the optimism and energy of the start of this year through LISA, MiFID II, Brexit and all the rest of it.<br/>To visit the lang cat’s new platform directory, just go to www. langcatfinancial.co.uk/platform-directory<br/>","12<br/>Three into one won’t go<br/>Nick French | Managing Director, Head of Wealth Management | Russell Investments<br/>Splitting clients’ needs into separate portfolios makes more sense than a single, all-encompassing investment strategy.<br/>After years of price stability, inflation is finally rearing its head again. The UK inflation hit<br/>a two year high of 1.6% in December of<br/>2016 and may well move higher if, as Russell Investments’ strategists believe, inflationary trends materialise worldwide. A rising inflation trend is always a concern for private investors, particularly for those who remember the damaging inflationary surge in the 1970s.<br/>Clients are already asking their advisers how they can protect their portfolios against inflation. But the chances are they only need to hedge part of their retirement assets, not all of them. It really depends what kinds of assets they have, what they are being used for and how long they intend to hold them.<br/>Hedging only part of the assets is complicated in a single portfolio. In fact, the management of a pool of assets with the aim of meeting all of a person’s later life needs is a tough proposition. In this light, does a single retirement portfolio make sense? Would<br/>it not make more sense to create several portfolios each with different goals and specific risks – such as inflation – and manage them separately? We think it might do.<br/>Each portfolio must have a defined role<br/>Many people think of their retirement savings as a single pot which will serve all their later life needs. That doesn’t make sense for the majority of clients. Most people have more than one goal and each goal has its own time horizon and implicit tolerance for risk.<br/>So clients would be better served with, say, three portfolios which aim to cover the following three key costs of retirement:<br/>1. The essentials 2. Lifestyle<br/>3. Estate<br/>Each portfolio will be affected by different risk factors – which may include rising inflation<br/>– and can be managed to mitigate or benefit from the relevant risks.<br/>1. TheEssentials<br/>The essentials portfolio must provide a degree of certainty. Being able to put food on the table, heat the home, run a car and afford healthcare are not optional.<br/>The portfolio will look considerably different from one which is designed to meet the three key costs combined. The essentials investment strategy should have low volatility and provide some protection in down markets, but also allow for modest growth.<br/>This demands a largely defensive portfolio, such as Russell Investments’ Multi Asset Growth Fund I, in which a significant portion is invested in Fixed Income. The target return of this fund is around 4.3% a year, which would turn £1,000 into £1,508 after 10 years. Perhaps more importantly for the essentials portfolio, there is only a 5% chance that the 10-year return is below £1,136.<br/>Might inflation hedging be part of an essentials portfolio? Probably. A client approaching retirement, or in retirement, certainly doesn’t want substantial erosion<br/>of their everyday spending power. Inflation hedging may occur naturally in the chosen assets or it can be addressed explicitly through a weighting to inflation-linked bonds, commodities or certain equity sectors.<br/>","13<br/>Would it not make more sense to create several portfolios each with different goals and specific risks – such as inflation – and manage them separately? We think it might do.<br/>2. Lifestyle<br/>Lifestyle needs in retirement could include discretionary spending on holidays, dining out, presents for grandchildren, sports and other activities. To provide the potential to increase discretionary income, this portfolio must take more risk than the essentials portfolio, but not so much risk that the grandchildren go without Christmas presents.<br/>Russell’s Multi Asset Growth Fund III is more than 50% invested in higher-risk growth and real assets and the rest is in lower-risk defensive assets. The target return is a little higher than the essentials portfolio, at 5.9% a year.<br/>What about an inflation hedge for this portfolio? It should certainly be considered. Life’s little luxuries tend to rise with or faster than inflation, so some explicit inflation protection may be wise.<br/>3. Estate<br/>Once clients are confident they can save enough to cover essentials and lifestyle needs, any surplus can be put towards building an estate for the benefit of family, and perhaps friends and charities too.<br/>The time horizon is a lot longer for this portfolio, and may be 30 years for a fit 60-year-old. This portfolio could therefore be weighted to longer-term assets and,<br/>for maximum growth, could be much<br/>more heavily invested in stocks. By our calculations, over 30-year time horizons, stocks have a 99% chance of outperforming bonds and cash.<br/>The Russell Multi Asset Growth Fund V, for instance, is 90% invested in higher risk growth and real assets, and has a target return of 7.2% a year.<br/>For this portfolio, inflation protection is probably not critical. Over very long time- frames, inflation should stay within historical norms. In addition, a well-diversified stock portfolio should provide some natural inflation hedging.<br/>Multi-portfolio approach helps sustain trust<br/>Creating three discrete portfolios may not only manage risks better, but should also encourage clients to stay invested. Consider the 2008 end-of-year review: a moderate risk portfolio was down by some 20%. That their portfolios performed better than the stock market overall, or that they beat some kind of blended benchmark would have been no solace at all to clients.<br/>But what if you could have reminded them that they had three portfolios, not one, and each one was still largely on track to meet their needs?<br/>The essentials portfolio minimised risk and would have been down by just 6%. So the client could still eat and have a roof over their head even if asset prices did not recover. Which, of course, they did – and more.<br/>The lifestyle portfolio was down 20%. Not great, but the grandchildren’s toys are safe and the worst case scenario is fewer holidays or a less expensive golf club for a couple of years.<br/>The estate money, entirely invested in shares, is down 45%. This appears disastrous, but there are 20-odd years for asset prices to recover so that clients can still leave a healthy chunk of money to their heirs.<br/>In other words, it is possible to better manage clients’ expectations with a multi-portfolio approach, and this can sustain trust when times get tough.<br/>Conclusion – maintaining the viability of goals<br/>If the next crisis turns out to be linked to rising inflation, expectations can be similarly met by having managed inflation risks in each portfolio.<br/>There is, of course, no perfect anti-inflation portfolio, just as there is no crisis-proof portfolio, but being able to mitigate the risks and maintain the viability of the various financial goals gives clients peace of mind.

It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so.” – Mark Twain<br/>• For this, I looked at every 30 year period between 1900 and 2015 inclusive. So the first 30 year period runs between 1900- 1929, then 1901-1930, 1902-1931... and final 30 year period runs between 1986- 2015. This gives 87 scenarios.<br/>• The portfolio is composed of 50% UK Equities and 50% UK Bonds, re-balanced annually.<br/>• No fee has been applied but when I retested the result with fees applied, the findings hold regardless.<br/>• I examined the correlation between average sustainable income and the volatility over 30 year retirement period.<br/>The Result?<br/>There is little correlation between volatility and sustainable income. Regardless of the period considered, income is as likely to be high and sustainable with a high volatility as it is with low volatility, provided the equity allocation in the portfolio remains constant.<br/>The movie Big Short opens with the above quote, which sums up the danger of thinking you know something that isn’t actually<br/>true. There’s only one problem. There’s little evidence that Mark Twain actually said or wrote those words, which makes the irony all the more powerful.<br/>In a misguided attempt to manage sequence risk in retirement income portfolios, a great deal of effort is devoted to managing volatility. This has resulted in a vast number of ‘volatility managed’ funds and model portfolios peddled by asset managers to advisers and clients in retirement.<br/>The trouble is, managing volatility in retirement portfolio is, for the most part, a red-herring. It’s a bit like bringing a knife to a gunfight.<br/>In a retirement income portfolio, volatility isn’t your enemy per se. Sequence risk is. Sequence risk is often confused with volatility. I fell into the same error in my early days of researching retirement income strategies but looking at the empirical data more closely I realise that, while the two are related, they’re very different.<br/>Volatility has very little impact on the order of returns. Two portfolios might have the<br/>same average return (mean) and volatility (standard deviation) over a given period of time, but if the order (sequence) of returns is different, then the sustainable income would be different.<br/>The Big Test<br/>To measure the impact of volatility on sustainable income, I used the same dataset as my previous research; actual historical data over the last 115 years, between 1900 and 2015.<br/>This time, I look at the relationship between historical sustainable withdrawal over any 30 year period and volatility obtained over each of the 3 decades of retirement within that 30 year period.<br/>Source: Finalytiq<br/>","15<br/>Managing volatility in retirement portfolio is, for the most part, a red-herring. It’s a bit like bringing a knife to a gunfight.<br/>While there’s a very strong correlation<br/>(83%) between returns in the first decade of retirement and the sustainable withdrawal over the entire 30-year retirement period, I find little correlation between volatility and sustainable income. There’s a less than 10% correlation between volatility in the first decade of retirement and the sustainable income over a 30-year period. Even when I examined the correlation between volatility over the entire 30-year period and sustainable income, I only found a 32% correlation! Sustainable withdrawal rate has little to do with volatility itself.<br/>In an article published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Retirement in 2014, Kenigsberg et al carried out similar research using monthly historical data of US stocks and bonds.<br/>They noted...<br/>To further test whether sequence of return (SOR) risk in the first decade overshadows volatility risk in determining the maximum Sustainable Withdrawal Rate (SWR), we ran<br/>a regression analysis on historical maximum SWR (as a dependent variable) first with the first decade’s real return and then with the first decade’s volatility as possible independent variables, using a 50/40/10 portfolio and the historical returns for the 702 complete 30-year periods between January 1926 and May 2014. We found that using the first decade’s real return as the independent variable produces an R2 value of 73%, whereas the regression using<br/>the first decade’s volatility yields an R2 of only 1%. Although the use of overlapping periods may complicate this statistical approach, we think the analysis at least suggests a greater influence from sequence than from volatility.<br/>Investors may be tempted to use investment strategies designed to produce relatively<br/>low volatility (and accept the typically lower returns that come with them) during the early part of their retirements in order to minimize the probability of an adverse sequence of returns. But this is not necessarily effective.<br/>A strategy that produces low volatility may nonetheless deliver a highly disadvantageous sequence of returns because SOR risk and volatility, although not unrelated, are not the same thing. A poor SOR can just as easily be the product of persistence in returns (or autocorrelation) as of volatility.<br/>So, what?<br/>Sequence risk is the primary investment risk in retirement. Not volatility. Controlling volatility doesn’t necessarily control sequence risk.<br/>Many asset managers are barking up the wrong tree! The deluge of volatility-managed solutions designed for retirement income most likely won’t work. In fact, taking volatility off the table may end up being dangerous for retirees because it impairs return. Add to that the impact of high fees that these products typically charge, they may actually amplify the sequence risk rather than reduce it.<br/>www.finalytiq.co.uk www.twitter.com/AbrahamOnMoney abraham@finalytiq.co.uk<br/>Sequence risk is the primary investment risk in retirement.

Some contend that a ‘lack of knowledge’ may be preventing legitimate use by financial advisers in the UK, especially in light of the stunning adoption rates in the United States.<br/>The stats around the rise in global ETF sales are truly astounding. From their introduction in the early 90’s, they have grown to invested assets of over $2.99 trillion. Mutual or unit trust funds trade at their ‘net asset value’, whereas ETFs issue shares that trade like individual stocks. The Blackrock marketing information states:<br/>‘They are transparent, cost-efficient, liquid vehicles that trade on stock exchanges like normal securities.’<br/>What’s not to like? The structure of the data in a tool like Synaptic Product and Fund ensures you can identify all the key attributes, and<br/>sort them correctly by sector or feature. For insight purposes only, let’s compare a couple<br/>of UK active managed funds with a passive<br/>and a couple of ETF options. It is interesting to observe the already burgeoning fund sizes of the leading ETF’s, but also the considerable out- performance of the leading active managers. If you are not regularly trading your position, why buy an ETF if you can capture the desired index in an inexpensive, passive unit trust?<br/>So what about the risks?<br/>An important consideration for UK investors is the possibility of serious disruption in the event of suspension or collapse, and most<br/>importantly the FSCS. ‘Synthetic’ ETFs that have exposure to derivatives and counterparty risk are not recognised by the FCA and<br/>could experience wipe-out with no compo. Shorting, inverse and leveraged strategies can be extremely complex and therefore opaque<br/>- difficult to regulate and unpredictable. An investment strategy designed for long term retail investment is unlikely to use these sophisticated instruments.<br/>The due diligence points:<br/>• Do you understand what you are buying?<br/>• Can you define and quantify the advantages and the disadvantages? Risk of systemic failure in fragile areas of investment is perhaps the greatest unknown here.<br/>• Doestheinvestmentalignwiththeclient’s objectives and meet the proof of suitability requirements around risk, price and understanding?<br/>• Whatabouttaxation,off-shorestatusand recognition by the FCA?<br/>• Ifaclientwantsgoldexposuredoyoubuy the ETF, which is cheap and convenient?<br/>Assets belonging to ‘physical’ (as opposed<br/>to ‘synthetic’) ETFs will be ring fenced and protected in the event that the Fund Promoter<br/>deceases, but questions remain as to how an investor may fare at times of stress, given that they do not own the underlying investment, but rather shares in the vehicle. ‘Flash crashes’ and a range of other problems relating to short term investment strategies point to possible weaknesses more generally. Irrational share prices add an extra layer of uncertainty, and the benefits of good governance, diversification and long term commitment may be undermined in unknowable ways in these relatively early days.<br/>This debate points to how the traditional role of ‘gatekeeper’ is diminishing for advisers, and the role of ‘coach’ is growing. The real risk<br/>of more widespread adoption could be the unintended behavioural changes including speculation and short termism that do not lead to reliable or predictable investment outcomes, eroding the value proposition that has been painstakingly built by the industry.<br/>Having a serious look at ETFs will be a beneficial exercise to every firm – if only to put what you currently do into greater perspective.<br/>For more information on Synaptic Product & Fund call 0800 783 4477 or visit www.synaptic.co.uk<br/>*Article originally published in Financial Planning Today Magazine, reproduced by kind permission.<br/>","17<br/>The Suitability Suite<br/>Risk .

On the other hand, adherents to active argue that despite this, many active managers do still add value. This means that the debate can feel polarised, with passive at one end of the spectrum and active at the other end. At Vanguard, however, we think the active- passive decision requires a more<br/>nuanced approach.<br/>The fact we say this may surprise some who think of Vanguard primarily as a passive fund manager. It’s true that we have a great deal of experience in passive investing (our founder, John Bogle, actually founded the first traditional index fund), but we also have a long history in active investing. While we maintain that the majority of investors may find that that they are well-served using a 100% passive allocation, we also think that a certain level of active exposure may be appropriate for some investors.<br/>A more nuanced approach<br/>So how can investors decide which approach<br/>will suit them best? Both active and passive have potential benefits in a portfolio. Passive funds typically offer low-cost benchmark tracking, leading to returns that are close<br/>return. Does the investor (or an adviser) have the resources and expertise necessary to identify outperforming managers? If so, do they believe that the manager for a particular active strategy has the ability to add value over time through a disciplined process and experienced and deep investment team?<br/>There is considerable evidence that as the cost of investing decreases, the odds of outperformance in active strategies increase. A fund’s current expense ratio has historically proved to be an effective predictor of relative future fund performance. Investors must ask whether they can access the strategies under consideration at a reasonable cost.<br/>Any active fund by its nature deviates from its benchmark to try and improve returns. No active manager will outperform the market at all times and even those managers who have produced successful performance over longer periods of time have also typically experienced extended periods of underperformance. This manager risk can be thought of as active risk, or the volatility<br/>of a fund relative to the target benchmark. When compounded over time, this active<br/>to the market index. Active funds offer the potential for outperformance, but usually in exchange for a wider range of relative returns (in other words, much more uncertainty) and typically, higher costs.<br/>Because there are benefits and drawbacks to each approach, each investor’s personalised active-passive allocation will be driven by factors relating to their own expectations and preferences. Investors can use these factors to help assess the appropriateness of including active or passive funds in their portfolio.<br/>The factors<br/>We think there are four factors that investors need to consider: alpha expectation, cost, active risk and active risk aversion. Let’s look at each of these in turn.<br/>Alpha expectation can be interpreted as skill or talent. It’s the degree of confidence an investor has in the ability of the active fund manager to generate alpha, or excess<br/>","19<br/>While we maintain that the majority of investors may find that that they are well-served using a 100% passive allocation, we also think that a certain level of active exposure may be appropriate for some investors.<br/>Figure 1: Active-passive decision factors<br/>Source: Vanguard Asset Management<br/>risk can lead to performance that differs substantially from the alpha expectation. How much active risk do the strategies under consideration take on?<br/>Related to the third factor is the final factor, active risk aversion. To what degree is the investor willing to take on active risk in pursuit of outperformance?<br/>The above image shows how answers to each of the factors might lead to either a higher passive or a higher active allocation.<br/>It’s important to say that the impact of these four factors is to be evaluated in regards to the active selections the investor is considering, not the passive alternatives (since we know passive funds have a gross alpha expectation of zero, can be obtained at a very low cost,<br/>and offer relatively little active risk). The attributes can be thought of in terms of a sliding scale - each one individually leading an investor to lean more towards active or passive. Combining the investor’s responses can help provide a sense of whether they are predisposed to a more active or passive portfolio. For a large portion of investor situations, a 100% passive may be the right<br/>choice. But for those investors who expect<br/>to be able to identify outperforming active managers and access them at a reasonable cost, their active-passive combinations will be determined by the varying levels of active risk on offer and their aversion to that active risk.<br/>Important information<br/>This document is directed at professional investors and should not be distributed to, or relied upon by, retail investors.

The FCA does not hold back in its criticisms. Closet trackers, fund governance by fund managers, absolute return funds, vertically integrated firms, investment consultants, and direct to consumer platforms. They are all in the firing line.<br/>The study makes several recommendations which will have far reaching consequences for asset managers, but the impact will be felt by financial advice firms and they should act now.<br/>Financial advisers and planners have a<br/>key role as suppliers of good governance, fiduciary management, tax planning, cashflow analysis and the delivery of good customer outcomes.<br/>Mutton dressed up as lamb<br/>The FCA found that “many active funds offer similar exposure to passive funds, but some charge significantly more”.<br/>“There is around £109bn in expensive funds that closely mirror the performance of the market (they have a tracking error below 1.5) and are considerably more expensive than passive funds”.<br/>The regulator is very concerned that funds need to report clearly against benchmarks<br/>– so investors and advisers can draw robust conclusions about risk, return and costs – that’s a great step forward.<br/>But it does mean the FCA now knows what it thinks are poor funds – advisers need to make sure they are reviewing portfolios to make sure there are none lurking.<br/>So how good are you – really?<br/>The FCA has concerns about how asset managers communicate their objectives and outcomes to investors. It proposes to help retail investors identify the best fund for them by requiring asset managers to be clear about the objectives of the fund and report against these on an ongoing basis. It also says it will look at providing tools for investors to identify persistent underperformance.<br/>Advisers need to make sure that they have robust screening processes for the funds they select, or are selected on their<br/>behalf. And they need to make sure that managers deliver.<br/>The answer is not in the stars<br/>Rating agencies fall squarely into the FCA sights. The FCA found that 5-star share classes (rated by Morningstar) do not significantly outperform benchmarks net<br/>of charges. However, 5-star rated funds still managed to perform better than non-5-star rated funds. In simple terms, all funds are poor but 5-star rated ones are less poor!!<br/>Advisers need to make sure that they review their selection criteria, the external agencies that they use and make sure that they monitor outcomes on a regular basis.<br/>Past performance?<br/>Investors may choose to invest in funds<br/>with higher charges in the expectation of achieving higher future returns. However, the FCA found “that there is no clear relationship<br/>","21<br/>With more customers, greater wealth and fewer advisers, this should be the golden age of advice - time for advisers to take the next step up and become the true fiduciary for their clients.<br/>Figure 1.3: Trends in the asset-weighed OCF for active share classes over time<br/>Source: OCF data and information about the fee structure of share classes from a sample of managers enriched with information from Morningstar Direct.

It will be no surprise then that the FCA will require advisers to use other metrics when selecting funds. Costs (whether active or passive) need to be high on the agenda.<br/>Active and passive<br/>Passive is lower cost, active is more expensive - neither beat their benchmarks.<br/>The study found that active fund fees have not changed over 5 years (see figure 1.3), whereas passive fees have fallen substantially (see figure 1.4). Average OCFs for active equity funds were 0.9% p.a. whereas passive funds were 0.15% p.a.<br/>The issue of transaction fees has been brought to the fore in recent years by the active vs passive debate. The FCA is coming at it differently – investors need to have a clear idea of the total costs to be able to make better decisions. It therefore proposes introducing an all-in fee approach to quoting charges so that investors in funds can easily see what is being taken from the fund.<br/>Advisers should be able to continue to justify a greater share of the overall costs – by driving down platform and fund costs and demonstrating the value of their advice.<br/>Absolutely?<br/>The FCA flags two concerns over Absolute Return Funds (ARFs), many of which (its analysis shows) have sustained periods of negative returns:<br/>1. Many ARFs do not report their performance against the relevant returns target. An ARF may fail to achieve its performance objective of beating a cash benchmark by 2%. But show performance against a cash benchmark only, gives the impression that they have outperformed when they have beaten cash but by less than the 2% objective.<br/>2. FCA has concerns about ARFs that charge a performance fee when returns are lower than the performance objective the fund is aiming to achieve. The manager is rewarded despite not achieving the target performance.<br/>The FCA proposals on clearer objectives and reporting against them is clearly intended<br/>to address these issues, as will greater governance of manager and client alignment.<br/>Advisers should note that the FCA<br/>has picked out Absolute Return Funds for scrutiny and make sure that they regularly review the returns vs the published objective, the fees (including any performance fees) and the overall returns of any ARFs.<br/>Summary<br/>All in all, it is a scathing attack on the asset management value chain – not just asset managers but platforms, networks and ratings agencies all have their work cut out.<br/>Advisers should find the greater transparency and reporting helpful in constructing portfolios – though they are going to have to sharpen up their act to show how they add value.<br/>Time to review your investment philosophy and process (CIP) and the selection process for funds and managers.<br/>Also time to review existing holdings to make sure that the best possible portfolio is in place for all customers (after the excellent returns of 2016 it probably isn’t a bad time to do this anyway).<br/>David A Norman aka DAN www.tcfinvestment.com @tcfDAN david.norman@tcfinvestment.com<br/>","22<br/>A desynchronising world<br/>John Husselbee | Head of Multi-Asset | Verbatim Asset Management<br/>The steep rise of bond yields in recent weeks and months hasn’t really been a surprise – but nor did anyone really know when the sell-off would begin. Investors had recognised the remarkable over-valuation of the asset class for a long time, but the greater fool theory dictated they had an incentive to stay invested while prices kept rising, with yields compressing.<br/>Bond yields have been incredibly low, and unsustainably so, for some time, with over $13.4tn in debt estimated to be on a negative yield in August of this year (source: FT/ Tradeweb). The problem is that only a brave investor would shun such an overvalued asset if they believe enough buyers remain in the market that the price can rise even further.<br/>We must be careful making predictions about the bond bubble bursting as we have seen yields back up before, only to subsequently resume their multi-year bull trend. But yields are so low that the asset class on a standalone basis looks one of the most expensive ever,<br/>so it seems likely we may have reached an inflexion point.<br/>A range of factors have contributed to the sell- off. Inflation expectations have been edging up to reflect the lagged impact of the early 2016 recovery in energy prices. For UK investors,<br/>this has been accentuated post-Brexit vote<br/>by the likelihood of imported inflation due<br/>to sterling’s fall. We have also seen growing acceptance that QE and similar monetary measures may be losing their effectiveness in dictating investor behaviour, and therefore may be coming to an end (meaning less demand for bonds).<br/>Recently, the rise in inflation expectations and yields has gathered pace. We would attribute a large part of this spike to two related factors: populism and a switch to fiscal stimulus.<br/>Populism has gathered momentum, with perceived anti-establishment votes in the UK, US and Italy over the course of 2016. The driving forces behind this political trend are the same that may see a rejection of globalisation and a rise in domestic fiscal investment – via infrastructure projects for example. Few would argue that globalisation<br/>does not serve to increase productivity within the global economy, but the man-on-the- street in the developed world is becoming increasingly aware that the benefits may not be accruing to them, but rather to developing<br/>In recent years, synchronisation between asset classes internationally has been rising, a result of global efforts to stage a recovery from the 2008 global financial crisis.<br/>","23<br/>We must be careful making predictions about the bond bubble bursting as we have seen yields back up before, only to subsequently resume their multi-year bull trend.<br/>nations, who are closing the inequality gap, and to international businesses (and their shareholders).<br/>In recent years, synchronisation between asset classes internationally has been rising, a result of global efforts to stage a recovery from the 2008 global financial crisis. One of the main effects of quantitative easing has been to drive valuations up across the board, defying the traditional negative correlation between equities and bonds.<br/>Monetary policy may now be falling out<br/>of favour, but fiscal stimulus is back in<br/>vogue, underpinned in the UK and US by infrastructure projects.When combined with a trend to restrict the free movement of labour, the takeaway from the Brexit vote and Trump’s election is clearly reflationary. Employment in both markets is already fairly full, so turning off the tap of labour immigration will likely inflate wages and prices.<br/>With bond yields now rising across the board, it may seem that synchronisation remains firmly in place. However, if we look at the reasons behind this inflexion, I think it reveals something more telling, which points towards increasing de-synchronisation in future.<br/>The political forces we have already mentioned are currently driving bond yields in the same<br/>direction globally, but we believe they will eventually cause greater heterogeneity of returns. If countries introduce frictions to international trade and the movement of capital and labour, then their economies are likely to diverge and the debt (i.e. bonds)<br/>of each country is likely to be increasingly assessed on the merits of its own economy.<br/>This is one reason we will be taking an increasing international approach to our fixed income allocation. We have maintained our long-standing underweight position, but the asset class’ diversification benefits continue to justify an allocation in a balanced portfolio.<br/>Investors now have to look to other means of generating income and low-volatility returns, with the options including real estate, long/short equity strategies and strategic bond funds.<br/>Unfortunately, rising government bond yields are likely to have negative knock-on effects on other asset classes, all of which are ultimately to some degree priced at a premium to this risk-free rate. Even though their valuations look elevated, we are reluctantly tilted towards risk assets including equities and making use of managers with distinct and robust investment processes – who will, for example, be investing in companies resilient to inflationary pressures – and those that make use of innovative<br/>strategies, such as enhancing income through writing covered call options.<br/>De-synchronisation and greater heterogeneity means an opportunity for active managers to add alpha through their ability to research and differentiate between investments. The days of making straight risk-on or risk-off trades may be behind us as we see less intra-asset and inter-asset correlations. We have already seen sector rotation away from defensives towards cyclicals, and the next step will be to observe greater differentiation at the security level.<br/>www.verbatimassetmanagement.co.uk Email: info@verbatim-am.co.uk<br/>Phone: 0808 12 40 007<br/>Verbatim has taken due care and attention in preparing this document which is solely for the internal use of the intended recipient.

This was the<br/>front-page headline on FTfm back in October 2016. The article spanned two pages, five columns and included quotes from half a dozen industry professionals. To summarise in seven words; active funds are over-priced and under perform.<br/>Within the article an MEP comments that investment houses are “over charging their clients and failing to put investors first”. An industry CEO claimed fund managers are “essentially sitting on large amounts of assets and charging the wrong fees”. He also stated they were “unable or unwilling to take the risks to try and out-perform their indices”.<br/>What struck me about the article was not the findings of S&P’s research, nor the views<br/>of those lambasting the active sector. It was how a front-page article in a national paper, referencing politicians, the regulator, consumer protection groups and several asset managers could miss the point so badly. The article was so focused on active funds under-performing their benchmark that it failed to address the relevant question – why is this happening?<br/>There is a reason $24tn is invested in active funds globally. Active managers<br/>are not unintelligent. Nor do they go out of their way to do a bad job for investors. Castigating them for underperforming over a specific time frame does not help the underlying client, nor their IFA, understand why so many struggle to outperform a benchmark. Almost lost in 17 paragraphs of repetition, were 6 words which give an insight into the real issue; over the decade in question “high costs were hurting investment returns”.<br/>In order to understand this underperformance, one must examine<br/>the cost of running an active fund. This<br/>is not just the Ongoing Charges Figure (OCF) that appears on a fund factsheet. An OCF represents the tip of the proverbial ice-berg.

Identifying these trades and recognising the right time to place them, are only two parts of the puzzle.<br/>active manager decides to place a trade they must incur a cost for doing so. This cost may come in the form of a bid/offer spread, a brokerage fee or paying duties if purchasing an equity. Whatever the guise, an active manager must pay a cost when entering into every trade. To make matters worse, they must incur a further cost when exiting every trade. Therefore, if we make the (big) assumption that the average trade is successful, it must be successful enough to absorb two rounds of trading costs before it breaks-even for the fund. This is the best case scenario and by no means guarantees a significant contribution to fund performance.<br/>How much can trading costs add up to? One study, which aims to shine light<br/>on the “invisible costs” of active fund management, looks at 1,758 equity funds around the globe. The study concludes that trading costs have a negative impact on performance and are, on average, larger than the expense ratios quoted by the active fund managers. Across the sample the average trading costs were 1.44% per annum. For small-cap funds it was as high as 3.17% per annum. To be clear, these trading costs come in addition to the OCF published by active fund managers.<br/>Let us consider this for a moment. We operate in an industry where an active<br/>fund manager is only obliged to provide an OCF number which takes certain costs into account. These include anything classified as fixed, such as a fund manager’s AMC, audit fees, legal fees, custodian fees etc,<br/>as well as any cost borne by the fund with certainty over the next twelve months. On average let’s assume this results in an OCF of 1.00%.<br/>Now let us consider the average trading costs incurred by that fund over a twelve- month period (trading costs are classified as variable, and as such do not need to be included in an OCF). Suddenly, the average active manager must clear an approximate 2.5% cost hurdle every single year before any client gains a single penny.<br/>Therefore, an active manager must make 2.5% each year before they break-even. Combine this with the fact that not<br/>all trades are successful and you begin to appreciate the constant headwinds confronting an active manager.<br/>The aforementioned “high costs hurting investment returns” comment comes from the same MEP that claimed fund managers were “failing to put investors first”. An active fund manager will argue that they spend all day, every day, trying to do exactly that. By incurring significant trading costs, active managers demonstrate they are<br/>not “unwilling to take the risks to try and out-perform their indices”. However, this willingness appears to go hand in hand with exactly why they appear “unable” to do so.<br/>Trading costs can often be the single largest expense incurred by clients, yet seldom get mentioned by asset managers or elsewhere in the industry.<br/>Trading costs can often be the single largest expense incurred by clients, yet seldom get mentioned by asset managers or elsewhere in the industry. As an IFA, are you aware<br/>of the underlying trading costs within the portfolios you recommend to clients? Are you sure the “all in figure” you quote your clients (including your adviser charge and platform fee) is accurate?

Yet it restated their findings that ‘the poor quality of an advisory firm’s research and due diligence is one of the three root causes for poor consumer outcomes’. (The other two are incorrect<br/>risk profiling (see FG11/53) and costs (see FG12/16)).<br/>Here, we look at the area of platform due diligence.<br/>Is one platform enough?<br/>The FCA’s concerns over advisers using just one platform have constantly been highlighted. In the early days it may have been logical for an advisory firm to use<br/>a number of platforms, given that the functionality then offered was not as broad as it is today. However, as the numerous propositions have evolved and new providers have entered the market, competitive pressures have improved the level of functionality on offer, making the case for the<br/>use of one solution much more defensible and logical from a business perspective.<br/>If you use just one platform – in our view<br/>a sensible approach – the FCA quite rightly point out that advisers should have an ‘off- platform’ process to ensure the needs of all clients can be met. Again, our view being this applies whether you use one or more platforms.<br/>The RSMR Guide to Platforms<br/>At the time of our first guide to platforms back in 2006, usage was fragmented and there was a wide divergence in available functionality. Over the years, standards have emerged and today, the numerous platforms are much more homogeneous. Importantly, the opaque charging structures have at<br/>long last gone, yet some remain overly complicated.<br/>Once, a platform was seen as the panacea to the many issues that have beset our industry. Yet it is not the sole answer - any<br/>more than moving adviser remuneration to fee charging is the answer to stopping inappropriate advice.<br/>A platform can however play a part in helping a firm reposition their business model by improving their service proposition, streamlining the provision of data across a number of products or tax wrappers and developing more efficient administrative processes. These can combine together to help deliver improvements to client service and, together with evolving technology,<br/>can make access easier for advisers and end investors alike.<br/>By adopting a structured and robust approach to the selection of a platform, we believe advisers can meet their regulatory requirements and continue the journey towards making their business resilient, delivering improved levels of advice and building trust with clients.<br/>","27<br/>Financial Resources & Capital Adequacy<br/>Whilst delivering improved levels of client service is undoubtedly key, we have also long held the view that the financial resources available to a platform operator to back its proposition are equally important factors in any selection process. With the continuing focus on margins, the financial pressures on platform operators are unlikely to ease in the short term.<br/>In the event that a platform is closed, any process to ‘wind down’ that business and transfer assets will be both costly and time-consuming. In its comments on capital adequacy, the FCA wants to ensure that there are sufficient capital resources to be able to wind that business down in an orderly manner – this is known as the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment (ICAA).<br/>These details are contained within the Capital Requirements Directive and the Regulator in its ICAA guidance wants firms to consider:<br/>• the likely period the firm believes it would take to wind down its regulated activities;<br/>• the likely costs incurred by the business during this period including any additional ‘closure’ costs;<br/>• realistic cash and fund in-flows and out- flows during the wind down period; and<br/>• additional losses or liabilities that could crystallise during the wind down period.<br/>These concerns have been raised previously by the FCA and they restate that under Principle 10 ‘a firm must arrange adequate protection for clients’assetswhenitisresponsibleforthem’ and they continue to assess the adequacy of protection provided by firms and make it clear that this applies to platform operators.<br/>Key Issues<br/>Initially, firms need to satisfy themselves on three key issues:<br/>SCALE – Does the platform operator have the scale and resources (both financial and technical) to be a long-term-player?<br/>Clearly without the scale and resources to<br/>be a long-term player, one would have to question the future availability of the platform and therefore the support given to those clients who use it. (Look at recent events involving Avalon and AXA Elevate)<br/>FUNCTIONALITY – Do they provide the range of tools and functionality required to embed your new business model and help you deliver an enhanced service and your Centralised Investment Proposition (CIP)?<br/>Given the complexity of some of the asset allocation and investment tools included on the platforms, consideration should also be given to available training on these aspects to ensure that all advisers understand the inputs, assumptions and outputs and can adequately explain these to a client.<br/>The range of tools needed to embed into the firm’s business model will depend entirely on the advice process. If an adviser intends to maintain the existing fact finding, risk profiling, and asset allocation and fund selection processes that they already have in place, then clearly they need not discount those operators who do not offer this functionality.<br/>SUPPORT – Can the platform provide necessary training and ongoing support?<br/>Thesupportgivenisalsocrucial. Some platform operators offer support to help to transfer clients onto the platform, perhaps by re-registering or consolidating existing investments. If there were large numbers of existing clients with existing investments to transfer to the platform then this support would be valuable.<br/>What is important here is to have a clear understanding of what support and functionality is required from the chosen platform and then consider the platforms that offer this. Only by doing this can the platform be fully integrated into the advice process, thereby giving access to the true cost savings that a platform can offer.<br/>The path to success in 5 easy steps<br/>Our own research with advisory firms suggests they are looking for a logical process to follow which will allow them to decide on two important points: is a platform right for their business and if so, which is the right one?<br/>The process starts with a review of business strategy and this step will help determine whether a platform solution is suitable to achieve the longer-term business objectives.<br/>The following diagram illustrates our due diligence process:<br/>Robust research and due diligence is fundamental and will help support your business in the delivery of suitable advice to clients; the message is clear – Just Do It.<br/>www.rsmr.co.uk<br/>email: geoff.mills@rsmgroup.co.uk Twitter: @RSMRTweets / @thegeoffmills<br/>","28<br/>Key DFM due diligence steps and the role of provider-level assessment as part of this process<br/>Matt Ward | Communications Director | AKG<br/>The requirement for, and benefits of, due diligence<br/>It is in the best interests of advisers to carry out robust and repeatable research and due diligence exercises when selecting partners for their business, including outsourced investment specialists such as DFMs.<br/>These exercises should be done to facilitate best practice within the adviser business and, crucially, to support the delivery of good customer outcomes. Furthermore, the regulator remains keen to see evidence of deeper and more engaged due diligence being carried out by advisers.<br/>In a market experiencing great change, due diligence will continue to increase in importance and is something which needs to be done when first identifying and selecting DFM partners, and then revisited on a regular basis.<br/>By adopting robust due diligence processes, adviser businesses will put themselves on the front foot with regards to sustaining winning relationships with DFMs, delivering pxositive customer outcomes and being able to better respond to change and challenge.<br/>Putting a due diligence framework in place<br/>There are a variety of ways in which an adviser business might go about their<br/>research and due diligence. In order to establish a robust and repeatable due diligence framework when selecting DFMs, and to create a supporting audit trail, AKG proposes a balanced four-step process which can be tackled in any order and covers:<br/>A suggested four-step framework<br/>Step 1 – Proposition research and analysis<br/>The nitty gritty research and analysis required to compare what’s available in terms of the proposition(s) being marketed by DFMs, i.e. What does the customer need? Who does what and how does it compare? Items may include analysis of:<br/>• Type of portfolio solution - BPS, MPS, unitised<br/>• Features and composition of portfolio service<br/>• Associated terms and conditions<br/>• Cost of service versus value provided<br/>• Accessibility of portfolio service via<br/>relevant product wrappers/platforms.<br/>Step 2 – Investment performance and style analysis<br/>When selecting a third-party investment specialist, an assessment of their performance credentials, and an understanding of their investment approach and style, will inevitably form part of the process for advisers:<br/>• Gain an understanding and be comfortable with investment approach and style<br/>• Seek out relevant past performance and request regular ongoing performance data<br/>• Match portfolio service to agreed risk parameters for customers<br/>Step 1 - Step 2 -<br/>Step 3 - Step 4 -<br/>Proposition research and analysis<br/>Investment performance and style analysis<br/>Operational capability and service delivery<br/>Provider assessment<br/>It is in the best interests of advisers to carry out robust and repeatable research and due diligence exercises when selecting partners<br/>for their business, including outsourced investment specialists such as DFMs.<br/>","29<br/>• Monitor portfolio service performance against objectives set at outset for the customer.<br/>Step 3 – Consideration of operational capability and service delivery<br/>Advisers should also try to get a feel for the infrastructure in place within DFM businesses to support the ongoing delivery of portfolio services to customers and advisers. Items may include consideration of:<br/>• Resource, staff, teams<br/>• IT systems<br/>• Risk management systems<br/>• Security of customer data and assets<br/>• Online/offline servicing capability<br/>• Integration with other relevant systems in<br/>the adviser business, i.e. CRMs, platforms.<br/>Step 4 – Provider assessment<br/>Beyond the headline level of assets under management held, advisers should seek to understand more about the DFM business that customer assets will be entrusted to by considering the following:<br/>• Business structure and senior management team<br/>• Core financials and capital position<br/>• Financial strength and sustainability<br/>• Operations, governance and risk<br/>• Image and strategy<br/>• Distribution capability.<br/>Contextualise selection through suitability testing<br/>A reminder on the balancing act at play here in terms of suitability. AKG feels that, ideally, suitability should be tested on two levels when selecting DFM partners:<br/>1) End customer level (individual customer and/or customer segments) - FCA commitment to ensuring good customer outcomes means that identifying and sourcing suitable solutions for customers will continue to be a crucial requirement.<br/>2) Adviser business/service(s) level - Adviser businesses have worked hard to re-engineer their structure, processes and service proposition in preparation for RDR, and hence they should rightfully be identifying and selecting DFMs that can fit with this operational structure, style and focus.<br/>It is vital that a logical and sensible combination of these suitability requirements is found. Otherwise there is a danger of over emphasis on solutions/ partners fitting the requirements of the adviser business rather than those of the end customer, i.e. ‘shoehorning’.<br/>Contextualise against evolving market<br/>Advisers should also seek to contextualise the due diligence process and the key considerations for their customers and their business considerations against the backdrop of an uncertain economic and political landscape, allied with an ever- changing financial services marketplace.<br/>Where to go for due diligence support<br/>Carrying out robust research and due diligence exercises can be resource/time consuming for adviser businesses and so advisers may need to seek support:<br/>• Go direct to DFM with Requests for Information<br/>• Consider support from independent third parties<br/>• Trade bodies may help with guidance and educational resources on the subject<br/>• Advisers should also endeavour to meet representatives from potential business partners in person.<br/>Introducing AKG’s DFM assessment work<br/>AKG is an independent organisation specialising in the provision of assessment, ratings, information and consultancy to the financial services industry. An independent company, AKG has provided detailed expert<br/>financial strength assessments (including ratings) and analysis to the UK financial services sector for over 20 years.<br/>AKG’s analysis draws on publicly available information, supplemented by other detailed information made available to AKG directly by providers.<br/>Traditionally AKG’s focus had been predominantly on life companies. However, in light of the growing impact of other entities and the underlying transformation in the financial services market in the UK, there has been increasing demand, from intermediaries in particular, to widen the scope of entities that receive specialist AKG assessment, including DFMs.<br/>Overall, the aim of AKG’s assessments is to provide independently evaluated information to assist in the choice of a service provider by the intermediary as well as to help in the understanding and appropriate development of the market.<br/>In line with its core focus, AKG’s assessment is primarily focused on financial strength. AKG considers that a major consideration for an intermediary, in considering a DFM<br/>is the comfort and assurance that can be obtained from an independent, external assessment.<br/>It is an important component in seeking<br/>to avoid the operational complications<br/>and potential brand damage that would be incurred should a chosen DFM encounter any financial difficulties, suffer a restriction on necessary investment to deliver required service and investment expertise/ capability, or in some other way ‘fail’.<br/>AKG assesses financial strength using consistent methodology and objective measures wherever possible, and the detailed analysis of the company’s particular strengths and weaknesses.<br/>For more information, email matt.ward@akg.co.uk or visit www.akg.co.uk<br/>","30<br/>Why is it so hard for firms to find Paraplanners?<br/>James Nadal | Deputy Editor | Financial Planning Today<br/>For some while, Financial Planning firms have been bemoaning the lack of suitable candidates to fill Paraplanning vacancies. But what are the reasons behind this? James Nadal investigates.<br/>Demand for Paraplanners has been outstripping supply for some time now, with Financial Planners bemoaning the lack of suitable candidates when they have tried to hire.<br/>Job adverts for Paraplanners are being posted frequently by Financial Planning firms via social media platforms and on job sites. But what is behind the problem with recruitment and is hiring as difficult as some say?<br/>Marlene Outrim CFPTM Chartered FCSI,<br/>a former IFP President, said it had been challenging at times. She said: “It has been a bit like feast and famine, as there have been times when we have needed Paraplanners and very few have been available for interview.<br/>“This resulted in us having to manage the workload within the team ourselves, and<br/>at one time, taking someone on who was not really suitable. We just hoped we could develop them. Later, once we had managed to recruit two really good Paraplanners,<br/>we were then inundated with CVs (not necessarily always good ones).”<br/>So, what does Ms Outrim believe are the primary reasons for this? She said: “Some of it is just down to timing and good luck, but often people who have been doubling up on roles, admin and Paraplanning feel they will make a good Paraplanner, or just want to improve salary from an all admin job, when it is obvious they will not. Recruiters and IFAs are to blame in blurring the lines between the two different jobs. We keep them very separate here, but I have often received a CV describing the candidate as an admin person who also obtains illustrations and writes a few letters for a full blown Paraplanner job. If we take someone on to develop in the role, then we class them as trainee, but we still keep the distinction clear.”<br/>Chartered Financial Planner Carl Lamb, founder and MD of Almary Green, said: “Recruiting Paraplanners is extremely<br/>hard, they are in high demand and in short supply – they can demand high salaries as candidates know how difficult the market is and they expect to be paid in relation to their technical expertise. We tend to find some<br/>candidates are no more than administrators. Paraplanning is a relatively new role to the industry, which may be part of the issue; there just aren’t enough of them around.”<br/>“We tend to find some candidates are no more than administrators. Paraplanning is a relatively new role, which may be part of the issue; there just aren’t enough of them around.”<br/>Carl Lamb, founder of Almary Green<br/>","31<br/>“If you do manage to find a Paraplanner locally, their skills aren’t guaranteed to match the ones you need due to each firm requiring different things of their Paraplanners.”<br/>Cathi Harrison, founder of Para-Sols<br/>Chartered Financial Planner Nicola Watts CFPTM Chartered MCSI, director of Jane Smith Financial Planning, said: “When<br/>we recruited in late 2015, although there were a number of candidates, they weren’t necessarily of the calibre we were looking<br/>for, but they were expecting top level<br/>salaries because that’s what they’d seen others could demand. For many, I think<br/>this comes down to a misunderstanding of what a Paraplanner really is. The historical view, which still exists widely, is that this is non-descript administration role, someone who is writing reports and completing basic research, but following instructions from an adviser. However, the role has in recent years developed into something that is technical and demanding.”<br/>Cathi Harrison, founder of Paraplanning firm Para-Sols, said recruiting, had been “extremely difficult in the past - so much so that we’ve given up in the past couple of years and moved to ‘grow our own’ instead”. She said: “There’s a number of different factors. There simply isn’t a large number of experienced Paraplanners in the UK. If your Paraplanners are office based, like ours, there are even fewer in your geographical region. Also, if you do manage to find a Paraplanner locally, their skills aren’t guaranteed to match the ones<br/>you need due to each firm requiring different things of their Paraplanners.”<br/>Kim George FPFS TEP, founder of Integrated Paraplanning Solutions, said: “Paraplanning experience is so varied and historically undervalued as a career choice with many seeing it as a stepping stone into advice, which has led to a shortage of quality, competent and qualified people. Paraplanning is moving more towards a professional career choice<br/>and specific learning and development programmes will undoubtedly help.”<br/>Ms George said when Paraplanners are trained in house they are embedded in the firm’s culture from early in their careers. But, she added: “I know from experience how hard it is to recruit, train and retain home-grown staff, particularly in a small to mid-sized firm where resources are finite.”<br/>Paraplanner Lewys Richards DipPFS supports more firms ‘growing their own’. He said: “There is a shortage of qualified and experienced Paraplanners in the UK, but a surplus of highly intelligent, capable graduates looking for careers. By growing your own Paraplanner, you can mould them to your firm’s culture and values. I entered the industry this way<br/>and we’re now looking to potentially take<br/>on another graduate to follow suit. Planning firms need to look at hiring graduates as an investment for the first year or two. This will convert into company turnover once they’re up and running as a Paraplanner. Maybe even more if they move on to advising.”<br/>Andy Marshall of Ovation Finance, agreed. He said: “Everybody wants an ‘off the shelf’ recruit. If nobody is training new entrants then this problem will only get worse. We can’t rely on the few large advisory firms to do all the recruiting and training. We also can’t rely on insurance companies as we once did. The industry reputation is much improved but I doubt people consider it as a career in the same way they would medicine, law, accountancy or teaching. Somehow, we need to appeal more to school leavers and graduates and to show them that this is a great industry to build.”<br/>You can view the website and the popular Financial Planning Today digital magazine at www.financialplanningtoday.co.uk.

In a year where politics may again provoke volatile markets, investors should be encouraged by funds that take an active approach to reducing risk.<br/>In order to manage the risk bands within the funds it is essential to both diversify across the asset classes and actively manage that diversified pool of assets in line with market movements.<br/>The broad diversification of the funds – which hold around 20 different asset types – has been instrumental in delivering this strong performance, while at the same time, smoothing the journey for investors along<br/>the way. Active asset allocation has also been key in helping us navigate three years of volatile markets that have included the first two US rate hikes since the financial crisis, a plunge in oil prices and the UK’s EU referendum.<br/>The power of diversification is clear from<br/>the fact that no single asset class was a ‘silver bullet’, with top performing assets coming from across the investible universe. US equities, UK equities, emerging market debt and direct UK property exposure (despite recent volatility) have all contributed strongly to returns.<br/>Three ‘Ds’ that delivered<br/>When we look back, we can identify three ‘Ds’ that have contributed to the funds’ strong performance:<br/>• Diversification: We have ensured that the funds are not too concentrated within any particular asset class. For instance, within fixed income we have exposure to global inflation-linked bonds, emerging<br/>market debt and global high yield markets. We also hold global property in order to diversify our UK property exposure and UK mid-cap stocks to avoid overreliance on UK mega-caps.<br/>• De-risking: More defensive positioning in periods of market weakness helped to protect portfolios on the downside. We have de-risked the funds at opportune times, thanks to our reading of the economic cycle, valuations and a range of systemic risks.<br/>• Duration: We have spent the last three years carefully managing duration (interest rate risk), particularly in those portfolios targeting lower risk levels. Within bonds, our mantra has always been to first diversify our portfolios and then to<br/>remain active in asset allocation across the spectrum. For example a higher fixed income weight proved beneficial at the volatile start of 2016.<br/>The power of diversification is clear from the fact that no single asset class was a ‘silver bullet’, with top performing assets coming from across the investible universe.

At the December meeting, the Federal Reserve also surprised investors with more hawkish guidance on monetary policy, signalling a possible further three rate hikes in 2017. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan continue to provide monetary stimulus support in the near term.<br/>In addition to the divergence in central bank policies, various political events pose systemic risks in the medium term. These include the President Trump’s unconventional agenda and unpredictable<br/>approach, the UK’s Brexit negotiations and elections across Europe.<br/>On the positive side, Chinese economic data has stabilised and policymakers seem determined to achieve shorter-term growth targets. However, we remain cautious on China over the medium term given the country’s rising corporate debt levels, but this key engine of world demand could provide a fillip for the global economy in what has become a period of substandard growth since the 2008 financial crisis.<br/>This is not a consumer advertisement. It is intended for professional financial advisers and should not be relied upon by private investors or any other persons. The value of investments and any income from them may fall as well as rise, and investors may get back less than they invest. Exchange rate changes may cause the value of investments and the level of any income to rise and fall. Multi-Index funds are sensitive to interest rate changes. At times, especially over shorter timescales, lower risk rated funds may fall in value by more than higher risk rated funds.<br/>","34<br/>2017: Be careful what you wish for<br/>Didier Saint-Georges | Member of the Investment Committee | Carmignac<br/>The global business cycle has gradually recovered over the course of the year from the low hit in the first quarter of 2016, before getting a further boost in November from Donald Trump’s unexpected win at the polls.<br/>Instead of worrying that economic growth figures might be disappointing for the umpteenth time or focusing on the many, oft- decried political risks facing Europe, it could be more relevant to consider the ramifications of the cyclical upswing under way that could prove decisive. That upswing is accompanied by two major consequences: a return of inflation – also cyclical in nature – and a stronger dollar.<br/>Investors might neglect to think seriously about how such an upturn will impact an already fragile bond market and, as a result, share prices. This would be unwise.<br/>Given the emerging combination of a cyclical upturn and a return of inflation, we can look forward in the coming months to a major test of market confidence in the central banks’ determination to keep interest rates close to their floor. That is the leading market risk that we need to prepare for in 2017.<br/>Long-term investors need risk management now more than ever<br/>Empirical evidence suggests that knowing when to take risk off the table is a valuable insight that can have a dramatic impact on long-term returns. Only skilful active<br/>management based on a clear understanding of risk can help investors benefit from multiple small “up” days, while reducing the potential for the most destructive “down” days.<br/>It sounds obvious that investors looking<br/>for a comfortable retirement should be focusing on long-term outcomes instead of short-term gains, but this proves harder to accomplish if your investment manager is preoccupied with beating their benchmark daily. To combat this, it’s worth considering an investment manager who is capable of seeing the investment world differently and has the conviction to take a fundamentally distinctive approach.<br/>Above all, it requires a manager who recognises that the real driver of long- term returns is the ability to manage risk successfully.<br/>Introducing Carmignac<br/>Carmignac has been acutely aware of these challenges since the late ‘80s and our original proposition was based around generational asset management (ie taking prudent decisions on behalf of your family and taking opportunities as they arise whilst mitigating risk where needed).<br/>Post-pension flexibility, advisers are increasingly managing money in the manner of a family office environment as clients look to pass their pension pots down through generations. Therefore Carmignac sees<br/>long term wealth planning of pension pots and capital as being vitally important in an increasingly volatile world to ensure there is money to pass down to the next generation. Hence you are not only looking to accrue growth but also to mitigate risk – which is a mantra of Carmignac as a house and as part of our tag line ‘Risk Managers’ since 1989.<br/>From the beginning, Carmignac’s priority has been to interpret the macro-economic environment. Its portfolio managers believe long-term investment returns can only be achieved by successfully managing risk. This requires a clear understanding of how core issues such as inflation, unemployment, interest rates, and economic growth drive the performance of global markets.<br/>Through the performance of its portfolios, Carmignac has also demonstrated it knows when to act in the best interests of investors by taking risk off the table through cost- effective use of derivatives and modern portfolio management techniques.<br/>","35<br/>From the beginning, Carmignac’s priority has been to interpret the macro-economic environment. Its portfolio managers believe long-term investment returns can only be achieved by successfully managing risk.<br/>A long-term solution for retirement savings<br/>Carmignac’s pioneering risk management approach is brought to the fore with our Patrimoine strategy, which invests across global equity, fixed income and currency markets. In English, the closest translation of “patrimoine” would be heritage. It’s a name that neatly encapsulates Carmignac’s investment philosophy.<br/>Carmignac Portfolio Patrimoine shares<br/>the same investment strategy, portfolio construction and the same management process of Carmignac Patrimoine. It is unconstrained by index composition. The intention is to ensure investors can sidestep future market shocks, while continuing<br/>to benefit from long-term “top-down” investment themes, and superior “bottom- up” stock and bond selection. This approach allows portfolio managers to construct an aggregated portfolio greater than the sum of its parts.<br/>Carmignac’s unique insights into the macro- economic environment give Carmignac Portfolio Patrimoine a clear edge. The portfolio managers can manage risk by determining long-term investment themes and making tactical asset allocation decisions, with the objective of ultimately, through the power of compounding, converting them into superior long-term returns.<br/>Not only does Carmignac Portfolio Patrimoine offer a solution for those investors still at the wealth accumulation phase of their retirement plans, but it also aims to mitigate risks during those periods of major market drawdowns that can be so destructive to long-term investments. As the old adage goes, past performance is not a guarantee of future results and all funds may present a risk of loss of capital.

If you’d added in Leicester City becoming Premier League champions and been brave enough to bet £5 on this highly unlikely outcome, bookmaker Paddy Power would have given you back £15 million. It was so improbable that no one took the gamble. Almost as unexpected is how equity markets have, so far, shrugged off Brexit and Trump.<br/>All of the above confirms how uncertain markets can be and, therefore, why it’s important to have a diversified investment portfolio.<br/>One fund which successfully navigated 2016 better than most is the Investec Cautious Managed Fund. Run by Portfolio Manager Alastair Mundy, the Fund achieved 1st decile performance1 over the year, returning 19.1% versus 10.6% for its peer group and 16.8% for UK equities (FTSE All-Share Index)2. The Fund has returned a very healthy 7.6%3 per annum (annualised) over more than 23 years.<br/>What contributed to performance in 2016?<br/>Alastair has maintained a blend of assets reflecting the under-valued opportunities he believes others are missing and the macro issues he sees as unresolved.<br/>In summary:<br/>• Cyclical, value stocks have performed well in 2016 after lagging both growth and momentum stocks for a number of years<br/>• AlastairstillbelievesthattheUSequity market remains expensive, but is always on the lookout for attractive individual value<br/>stocks. It’s this stock-picking that was a key contributor to outperformance in 2016.<br/>• With4.0%ingoldandsilversharesanda further 9.5% exposure to physical precious metals, the Fund has benefitted from strong returns from the yellow metal and resource equities. If you’re looking for a managed way to include gold exposure in your clients’ portfolios, it could be worth considering this Fund.<br/>Something different for your clients’ portfolios<br/>With a blend of assets which has proven its value across a turbulent year, we believe that including the Investec Cautious Managed Fund in your clients’ portfolios could provide<br/>a valuable and differentiated source of alpha throughout 2017. It’s an approach that Alastair has employed consistently over 14 years and has produced compelling returns over more than 23 years.<br/>• Proposed fiscal stimulus by Trump has boosted developed market equities but<br/>also increased inflation expectations when economies around the world are still fragile. The Fund’s inflation-linked bonds have benefited from these inflation expectations.<br/>• Yields on government bonds have increased as US interest rates look set to increase. The Fund has zero exposure to conventional gilts and US Treasuries at a time when they’re looking vulnerable.<br/>THIS COMMUNICATION IS DIRECTED ONLY AT PROFESSIONAL FINANCIAL ADVISORS.

However, what if the biggest risk is misunderstanding risk itself? An overly cautious approach may make it difficult to achieve financial goals. In this note, the M&G Multi Asset team aims to dispel some of the myths about risk that may be preventing your clients from taking advantage of opportunities to put their cash to work for better outcomes.<br/>All risk is bad<br/>Nobody likes uncertainty but ultimately investing comes down to accepting some level of risk/return trade-off. We believe that the biggest risk in investing is misunderstanding risk itself.<br/>Individuals who try to indiscriminately avoid all investment risk are likely to miss out on attractive opportunities to boost their returns. In our view, taking on some risk can be helpful, even essential, in meeting financial goals.<br/>The key is to ensure one is being adequately compensated for taking on that risk by investing in assets that are offering good value and therefore a margin of safety in their current price. Investors should aim to generate returns by taking appropriate levels of risk<br/>at the right price, within suitably diversified portfolios.<br/>Outcome-focused, actively managed multi-asset funds offer the potential to build diversified portfolios with some confidence that risk is being managed within certain bounds, while being used to generate attractive returns.<br/>Risk means volatility<br/>Investors often confuse ‘risk’ with ‘volatility’. We believe that investment risk ultimately<br/>comes down to one thing: the chance of losing money once it is time to close an investment (once the investor has ‘arrived at their destination’).<br/>Volatility, on the other hand, is a measure of how much the price of an asset moves over time. It gives a sense of ‘how bumpy the road is’ for an investor.<br/>However, volatility is only relevant if it is appropriate to the individual investor’s time horizon.<br/>Figure 1 illustrates two hypothetical investments. Investment A is certainly more volatile over short periods, so if you were planning to hold it for only a day, your chances<br/>Figure 1. Two investment scenarios<br/>Source: M&G, illustrative purposes only.<br/>of losing a significant amount are much greater than they are for Investment B.<br/>However, as you extend your time horizon, you can see that although Investment B is less volatile (that is, it moves less over shorter time periods) it has actually proven to be far riskier.<br/>This does not mean to suggest that we should ignore how returns are generated in trying to assess the quality of investment decisions. However, we need to move away from over- simplified, narrow definitions of risk towards asset-allocation approaches that are less prescriptively based on volatility assumptions and instead are more dynamic and diversified to help with delivering specific outcomes.<br/>Risk depends on the asset type<br/>One of the most dangerous myths is that risk is static. We must beware lazy assumptions such as ‘government bonds are low risk, equities<br/>are high risk’. Over the long term, equities<br/>have historically been more volatile and higher returning than bonds. However, there have been several periods in which bonds have underperformed equities.<br/>","39<br/>Nobody likes uncertainty but ultimately investing comes down to accepting some level of risk/return trade-off. We believe that the biggest risk in investing is misunderstanding risk itself.<br/>If true risk is about permanent loss of capital, then risk is in the price we pay for an asset (as compared to the price we sell it for). When investors begin to overvalue ‘certainty’ and consider an asset to be ‘risk free’, it is often at its riskiest. In our view, underpaying for equities is less likely to cause permanent loss than overpaying for bonds.<br/>So the risk characteristics of all assets are changeable and it is important to look out for incidents where emotional perceptions and not hard facts are driving the pricing of risk.<br/>It is easy to diversify away risk<br/>While we believe risk should not be confused with volatility, we acknowledge that volatility can be uncomfortable to tolerate. Diversifying portfolios can help to smooth the journey.<br/>The process of diversification is a cornerstone of basic investment principles. However, the process is not necessarily as straightforward as it may sound.<br/>When we understand that no asset is permanently ‘safe’ or ‘risky’, it is clear that we must take an active approach to managing the balance of assets within portfolios. Flexibility is key in responding to changing valuations, shifting economic fundamentals, fast moving news flows and fickle investor sentiment.<br/>One of the most straightforward ways of achieving genuinely effective diversification is, in our view, to invest in an actively managed multi-asset fund or funds.<br/>Risk can be avoided by predicting the future<br/>We do not believe it is possible to consistently forecast the future successfully as financial markets are highly complex and vulnerable to the impact of unpredictable investor sentiment.<br/>Instead, we recognise that the observable facts about the present are our best guide to the future. In other words, current asset pricing in the context of today’s economic environment is the strongest indicator of likely future risk.<br/>We can rely solely on risk models<br/>There has been a trend on relying on increasingly sophisticated risk models to manage risk. These models have their uses,<br/>but tend to be backward looking and overly mechanistic, and therefore, in our view, should not be relied upon exclusively. It is important to also take a qualitative, as well as quantitative, approach to assessing risk.<br/>In our view, managing both ultimate outcomes and the ongoing experience of our investors throughout market cycles is a better reflection of our approach to risk management than any single risk measure.<br/>M&G, December 2016<br/>The value of investments will fluctuate, which will cause fund prices to fall as well as rise and investors may not get back the original amount invested.<br/>For financial advisers only.

Everyone seems to have a special sauce to add to this recipe.<br/>Even otherwise, sensible advisers run the risk of being compromised by a fractured or otherwise inconsistent approach to risk. This is certainly the worry expressed by the regulator in various reviews. The reality is, that in isolation, all the bits could make sense, but unless they are correctly aligned they certainly do not.<br/>I would like to propose five rules of thumb to help conquer this difficult area:<br/>1. The extreme ‘granularity’ of some of these propositions is non-sensical and should be avoided. All the research into multiple ‘significant’ populations will pale into insignificance when compared with the real world circumstances of a client and his aspirations. The science can only ever be a guide.<br/>2. Youhavetobeabletoquantify‘Capacity for Loss’. In order for this to happen, you need a model that can predict the future. A model that can predict the future (that isn’t a crystal ball) can only make sense if it is a probability based model (and therefore ascribes a probability to all possible outcomes). A probability based model is created using simulation and is known<br/>as a stochastic model. (Yes, you have to<br/>embrace stochasticism).<br/>3. Having said that, you cannot rely on single measures for risk.<br/>4. Your investment strategy, including the ATRQ, risk categories and risk ratings need to align to the same model (preferably Moody’s), or at least be properly mapped.<br/>5. Diligent monitoring and review of your client’s investment journey will enable you to make appropriate adjustments along the way (remember of course that too little risk in some circumstances can be as bad as too much).<br/>If the estimates of failure in proof of suitability judged by the regulator in recent thematic reviews are correct, the majority of firms need to improve in this area. But where exactly are the gaps? Rory Percival’s summary at a recent conference is fairly succinct, quoted in the trade press:<br/>1. Risk descriptions<br/>“If you are using a risk profiling tool how you categorise the level of risk the client is willing to take and how you discuss that level with the client” was one concern, he said. “We still see examples which are quite poor for reasons we set out in 2011, for example using vague<br/>language or not quantifying the level of risk the client is willing to take. Clients need to be able to properly understand what kind of risk they are signing up to when they agree to the level of risk they are happy to accept.”<br/>2. Capacity for Loss<br/>FCA guidance now requires firms to consider Capacity for Loss, and there have been “huge steps forward in that area, which is very pleasing to see, although we still see pockets where firms are not addressing Capacity for Loss in a sufficient way.”<br/>3. The client’s knowledge and experience of investment<br/>Percival said; “This is the third element of the risk discussion and we’ve found sometimes it hasn’t been looked at, at all.... where a client has been asked, their answer hasn’t been taken into account in the recommendations made, and most particularly in the way those recommendations have been communicated to that client. For example, where the client is not able to understand the recommendations because the suitability letter used a lot of jargon and complex terminology which that particular client would not be able to understand.”<br/>","41<br/>“Clients need to be able to properly understand what kind of risk they are signing up to when they agree to the level of risk they are happy to accept.” Rory Percival<br/>Luckily, the Synaptic ‘Capacity for Loss Quotient’ of a fund or portfolio is an objective value, reassessed quarterly using the Moody’s Analytics stochastic model, representing the extent of possible loss in a bad (one in twenty) year. In broad terms Moody’s define a Cautious investor as one who can tolerate losses of up to 5% in a bad year in search for investment returns. (Balanced implies that up to 15% losses can be absorbed in a bad year, with the limit being Adventurous defined as a tolerant to losses of up to 25% in a bad year).<br/>The Synaptic Risk proposition has the advantage of being the only risk approach that relies exclusively on a mathematical measure for downside risk, which can be used to cover all compliance requirements:<br/>1. Effectivelymatchinganinvestmenttoa client‘s risk profile<br/>2. Usedtoquantify‘CapacityforLoss’<br/>3. Achieveinformedconsentfromclientwith<br/>expectation for risk and return that can be explained as percentage and in pounds, shillings and pence.<br/>Our rule of thumb infers that more than a single measure for risk is required. Additional comparisons looking at risk metrics, volatility and historical drawdown can be easily made. Fact sheets from Synaptic will also include commentary from Rayner Spencer Mills Research (RSMR), the UK’s leading provider of qualitative fund research. The combination<br/>of RSMR guidance and Synaptic quantitative values provides, in our view the gold standard for fund or portfolio research.<br/>Remember that in compliance terms, the<br/>true acceptance of risk by a client can only<br/>be made when an investment strategy is put into the context of a specific medium to long term goal. You cannot justify risk if there is no explicit aspiration for growth.<br/>The stochastic approach is superior to the deterministic approach in another important way – it emphasises the unpredictability of investment returns as well as the fluidity of the markets, the investment environment and of course risk itself. (Compare this to the<br/>typical misrepresentation of the nature of risk in the approach that you may currently be using). The adviser must therefore review progress... but that is fine, as that is what you are qualified, expert and paid to do!<br/>The graph shows how a selection of popular multi-asset investment solutions appear as Balanced investments in the Synaptic Risk analysis.

Synaptic Software have requested asset allocation information from participating providers in a specific format aligned to the risk framework of the system. These asset classes are used by the model to determine the risk rating, a process that may result in a level of approximation though in most cases this will be insignificant. It is also possible that certain asset classes may not be represented exactly in the manner that providers would prefer.<br/>Reasonable endeavours are made to provide accuracy and consistency, however neither participating providers nor Synaptic Software can be held responsible for any errors or omissions.
