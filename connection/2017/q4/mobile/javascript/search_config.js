I like it a lot because it combines the broader defensive qualities that many investors are seeking in their investment choices, and acknowledges the role of asset allocation and other strategies in achieving this. It also points to the fact that this\nis a rising concern appropriate to where we are, in relationship to the economic cycle’. It’s worth a look!\nFor those looking to manage investment\nrisk effectively, the new Synaptic Risk Rating service is growing rapidly and also worth\na look. The service has a mathematical pedigree second-to-none, re ecting (as we would like to think) a superior methodology over other ratings agencies who mostly take a ‘committee-based’ approach. The latter may have worked in the past, but advisers need to understand the dynamics of their underlying investments and monitor them more carefully than ever. We believe that a probability-based approach to investment and retirement planning is the only way forward. With Synaptic of course, you can get unfettered access to the leading probability- based model for investment outcomes from Moody’s Analytics, a service that reviews the underlying investments quarterly.\nDefensi cation? It’s worth remembering that the bull market in  xed income followed the 1980 14.7% peak in in ation. If the Treasury market does indeed move in 30-year cycles, yields may  nally be bottoming out. But that is assumption and\nspeculation, so the only sensible approach for clients is to take a measured exposure to risk, requiring the most reliable and well researched information and mathematical modelling to inform their asset allocation. Good research makes for good advice – more than ever before.\nMacrotrends – 10 year Treasury Rate historical chart (showing recessions). Lower for longer or in ection?

Customer Risk Pro les\nCustomers are assigned to a risk pro le (e.g. “Low Risk”, “Cautious”), based on a range\nof fact  nd information, typically including\na risk questionnaire. Risk questionnaires are designed to measure a customer’s attitude\nto risk, relative to a reference population. In terms of their risk aversion, where does the customer “rank” in the population. Risk pro les may be given textual descriptions which can be discussed with the customer to validate the result. This is a qualitative process, based on psychometric research and behavioral  nance.\n2. Fund Risk Rating\nEach risk pro le is characterised in terms of a quantitative risk target, based on de ned risk measure(s). Typical risk measures used are volatility or value at risk, which de ne a probable range of portfolio returns over a given term.\nA risk model, which uses mathematical equations and capital market assumptions to describe the behaviour of the risk factors, is used to quantify risk for each investment fund or portfolio, based on these same risk measure(s). This allows the fund to be “risk rated” against the de ned risk pro les.\n3. Asset Allocation\nThe same risk model can be used to identify asset allocations which maximise return for each de ned risk pro le. These “optimal” asset allocations will depend on an investment  rm’s proprietary views or forecasts for different asset classes.\n4. Risk Illustration & Cash ow Analysis\nIt is important that the customer is given a clear explanation of “risk” taking account of their own savings objectives. Cash ow analysis is a technique used for this purpose, and is particularly well suited to decumulation.\n•\n•\nOne industry report highlights apparent inconsistencies in asset allocations generated by different risk pro ling systems1\nRecently, other commentators question whether existing “centralised investment propositions” are suitable for use with “decumulation” customers2,3\nDebate over the use and abuse of risk pro ling tools is not news. However, upheaval in the retirement savings industry accompanied by long-term low yields, and the consequent growth in customers looking to use drawdown to fund retirement income, means it is ever more important to address the questions:\n• Is our chosen Risk Pro ling system valid for all customers, particularly for\nthose in “decumulation”?\n• Does the existing Risk Questionnaire work for customers in decumulation?\n• Are the existing Fund Risk Ratings valid?\n1 Rory Percival Training and Consultancy Ltd: An ex-regulator’s guide to Risk Pro ling Tools, 2017 2 CWC Research/Lang Cat: “Never Mind the Quality, Feel the Width 3”, October 2017 3 Danby Bloch: Time to sort out your decumulation strategies, Money Marketing, September 2017\n "," 5\n  (Accumulation Risk)\n  (Accumulation Risk)\n Key take-aways:\n• Risk measures used for accumulation are not reliable measures of risk for decumulation. For example, funds enclosed in the red box (Exhibit 2) are rated “low risk” for accumulation, but are “high risk” for decumulation\n• For decumulation, risk is dependent on the income level (cash ow) as well as the asset allocation\n   Accumulation\n  Decumulation\n   Savings Objective\nAccumulate wealth over savings term, based on regular contributions from salary.\n  Drawdown from accumulated retirement savings to generate a stable stream of income over the course of retirement\n Success Measures\nWhat does a “good” outcome look like?\n  Maximize value of wealth over savings horizon, relative to in ation\n  Maximize sustainable income over lifetime\n   Relevant Risk Measures\nWhich risk measures should be used for “risk rating” funds?\n Value at Risk: Size of fund losses in periods of “bad” investment performance\nProbable range for real value of wealth at end of savings term.\n   Risk of running out of money\nPotential reduction in sustainable income due to a “bad” sequence of returns.\n  Importantly, the Risk Framework opposite\nis based around a single set of customer\nrisk pro les. The implication of this is that\nthe de nition of the risk pro les and the associated fund risk ratings do not depend on the customer’s savings objectives. For example, if Fund ABC is rated “Low Risk” for a 30-year old accumulation customer, then Fund ABC will have the same risk rating for a 65 year-old customer seeking to generate sustainable retirement income.\nThis re ects the fact that these tools were developed to support customers accumulating wealth, but creates problems when attempting to apply existing tools in to decumulation customers.\nThe good news is the problem is not hard to  x.\nQuantifying Risk: Why is decumulation different?\nTo understand what will happen if we apply our existing “accumulation” Risk Framework to decumulation, we should consider why “risk” is different for accumulation and decumulation customers.\nIn Exhibit 1, we show a standard risk-return chart for an accumulation customer. Return\nis plotted on the vertical axis, risk on the horizontal axis. In this case, risk equals “value at risk” - the size of the biggest 1 year loss over a 20 year period. The different points on\nthe line denote ten risk-graded funds, with equity allocations from 0% to 100%.\nHow can the Risk Framework be adapted for decumulation?\nMany Risk Pro ling and Fund Risk Rating systems rely on a Risk Framework which has been designed for accumulation. As we have seen, this may not re ect the risks facing decumulation customers. The result will be risk pro les and fund risk ratings that make little sense.\nThe following table highlights the differences between the savings objectives, risk factors and describes the relevant risk measures we should use as a basis for the Risk Framework for decumulation vs. accumulation:\nThe funds are equally spaced along the risk axis, from low risk (0% Equity) to high risk (100% Equity).\nIn Exhibit 2, we extend this to decumulation, by making two adjustments to the chart:\n• We include income: the different lines on the chart represent increasing levels ofincome(asa%ofthe\ninitial fund), shown in the legend on the right\n• On the vertical axis, rather than return, we plot decumulation risk - the risk of running out of money. This is a more relevant measure of risk for a customer relying on their fund to support income through retirement\nExhibit 1: Risk vs. Return for an Accumulation Customer (No Income)\nIf decumulation risk is the same as accumulation, we should see lines running from the bottom left to the top right of this chart.\nExhibit 2: Accumulation Risk vs. Decumulation Risk\n    Moody’s Analytics works closely with clients and partners like Capita to understand the distinct savings objectives of different customer groups. In this way, our clients can adapt their risk pro ling and fund risk rating solutions accordingly.\n","  6\n Defensi cation:\nGoing beyond diversi cation\n John Stopford | Jason Borbora | Portfolio Managers | Investec Diversi ed Income Fund\nWhy be defensive?\nReading the signs of  nancial markets is always dif cult, and the market environment today makes for a particularly tough analysis.\nBuoyed by unorthodox central bank stimulus, many stock markets have risen to expensive levels while investors have been drawn into riskier and higher yielding bonds in their hunt for income.\nDespite the absence of asset price volatility, investor concerns are rising. How should they protect against the risk of a market sell-off now that this bull market is one of the longest on record?\nInvestors are right to be wary as avoiding signi cant losses can materially impact performance. Over the last 20 years, for example, an investor in the FTSE All Share who missed just the worst  ve months of performance would have beaten the index by over 600%.*\nAt Investec Asset Management, we believe the key to good investment defence lies in looking beyond the traditional, simplistic ‘top- down’ approach to portfolio construction that many investors adopt.\nTo us, the characteristics of an asset class matter much more than its ‘equity’, ‘bond’ or ‘alternative’ label. Instead of focusing on traditional asset allocation, or holding a\n xed proportion of bonds, equities and other asset classes in a portfolio, we choose to place a greater emphasis on understanding an investment’s ‘true’ behaviour and its relationship with the economic cycle.\nWhy?\nIn doing this, we seek to construct a portfolio that is genuinely diversi ed across a range\nof assets with growth, defensive and uncorrelated characteristics.\nMoreover, by investing only in securities with sustainable income streams and capital growth potential, we believe we can build a portfolio better able to handle episodes of market weakness and reduce the severity of drawdowns.\nFinally, a clear focus on downside risk management recognises that negative events can occur at any time, making it prudent to scale back exposure try to limit their effects.\nThese three layers of portfolio design underpin the objectives of the Investec Diversi ed Income Fund to deliver an income of between 4%-6% per annum**, with scope for capital growth and ‘bond-like’ volatility – which we de ne as less than half that of UK equities.\nDiversi cation versus ‘Defensi cation’\nThe Diversi ed Income Fund aims to provide a defensive return made up of an attractive level of income, as well as capital growth over the medium-term. The best way to achieve this consistently, we believe, is through the proper implementation of what we have termed ‘defensi cation’.\nWithin equities, for example, the perception that a company’s high dividend yield is a guide to its likely returns is erroneous. Simply because a company is paying out a high proportion of its earnings does not mean this is sustainable. What if the company is\nin distress or investors are forcing down the share price in anticipation of a dividend cut?\nSimilarly, high yields on sub-investment grade corporate bonds or emerging market debt may simply be warning of the risk of default.\nChasing yield without taking account of the accompanying risks can lead to painful capital drawdowns that far outweigh the level of income offered; often an asset offers a high yield because of the proportionately higher risks it presents. A bottom-up approach seeks to understand the sustainability as well as\nthe level of an investment’s income stream in addition to its potential for capital appreciation.\n*Source: Investec Asset Management, Bloomberg, June 2017 **Performance targets may not necessarily be achieved and are not guaranteed, losses may be made.\n  "," 7\n  A defensive approach starts with a genuine understanding of the resilience of the cash  ows supporting the dividends and coupons paid by individual securities.\n Take sub-investment grade corporate debt as an example. Those at the bottom of the credit rating spectrum, where the average yield over the past 10 years has been nearly double that of their more highly rated peers, suffered a drawdown in 2008/09 of nearly 20 percentage points more than less risky BBB/BB rated issues. Similarly, equities with the highest dividend yields underperformed the broader stock market during the  nancial crisis. A top- down approach may be able to achieve yield but it may come at the expense of resilience and capital.\nInvestec Diversi ed Income Fund: A portfolio beyond diversi cation\nA more defensive approach looks beyond simple diversi cation and the top-line yield offered by assets. Rather it requires a genuine understanding of the resilience of the cash  ows supporting the dividends and coupons paid by individual securities. This involves looking at measures such as pro tability, the stability of cash generation, the debt burden and how much  exibility there is to deal with a changing economic environment.\nThose securities we identify as providing attractive, sustainable income with potential for capital appreciation are used to build\na holistic portfolio with a mix of different exposures capable of achieving our investment objectives. The composition of the fund is actively managed, with no reference to any benchmark, to re ect changes to the economic\nbackdrop, the risk environment and the on- going desirability of each holding.\nBy taking these decisions, we aim to reduce the impact of drawdowns on the portfolio and improve investors’ probability of meeting their goals over long-term periods.\nTo  nd out more about how we implement ‘defensi cation’ in the Investec Diversi ed Income Fund visit www.investecassetmanagement.com/DIF\nFor professional investors only.\nThe value of investments, and any income generated from them, can fall as well as rise and will be affected by changes in interest rates, currency  uctuations, general market conditions and other political, social and economic developments, as well as by speci c matters relating to the assets in which the investment strategy invests. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results.\nSpeci c risks\nCurrency exchange: Changes in the relative values of different currencies may adversely affect the value of investments and any related income. Default: There is a risk that the issuers of  xed income investments\n(e.g. bonds) may not be able to meet interest payments nor repay the money they have borrowed. The worse the credit quality of the issuer, the greater the risk of default and therefore investment loss. Derivative counterparty: A counterparty to a derivative transaction may fail to meet its obligations thereby leading to  nancial loss. Derivatives: The use of derivatives may increase overall risk by magnifying the effect of both gains and losses. This may lead to large changes in value and potentially large  nancial loss. Developing market: Some countries may have less developed legal, political, economic and/or other systems. These markets carry a higher risk of  nancial loss than those in countries generally regarded as being more developed. Interest rate: The value of  xed income investments (e.g. bonds) tends to decrease when interest rates and/or in ation rises. Multi-asset investment: The portfolio is subject\nto possible  nancial losses in multiple markets and may underperform more focused portfolios.\nBond and Multi-Asset funds may invest more than 35% of their assets in securities issued or guaranteed by an EEA state.\n   ","  8\n Are you, your clients and your DFM partner MiFID-ready?\n  David Holloway | Marketing Director | Rathbones\nIn response to the 2008  nancial crisis, the European Union committed to strengthening investor protection and increasing transparency\nin  nancial markets – the result of these efforts is the new MiFID II regulations that come into effect on 3 January 2018.\nThis has important implications for professional advisers, their clients and the DFM providers they partner with.\nRegardless of Brexit negotiations, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has already committed to complying with the resulting MiFID II legislation, and here at Rathbones we have devoted much of 2017 to ensure key changes have been successfully implemented ahead of the deadline.\nHere are some of the key questions to be asking of your DFM partners to make sure you are ready for the new regime coming in 2018.\nHow are we ensuring investment solutions are suitable for the client’s needs?\nUnder MiFID II, ensuring portfolios are suitable to meet client objectives will place particular importance on demonstrating the full, transparent costs of managing a portfolio.\nThere will also be a requirement to provide new clients with a breakdown of anticipated charges in advance of providing investment services.\nOn cost disclosure, Rathbones will include a quarterly cost summary in client periodic\nreports (valuations) showing all charges associated with the management of the portfolio. On an annual basis we will report the cumulative effect that these have on the performance of the portfolio.\nIn addition, prior to bringing a new client on board, we will notify them of the estimated ‘ex-ante’ charges likely to be incurred on their portfolio in the  rst year.\nHow will you achieve best execution for clients?\nMiFID II mandates  rms to take ‘all suf cient steps’ to achieve best execution for their clients. The regulation mandates that clients are informed of any research charges applied to their portfolios, including those that are implicit in the execution rate provided by brokers.\nTo demonstrate best execution, we will publish on our website the top  ve brokers used to execute transactions. However, this will not directly affect our clients because we do not pass research costs onto our clients.\nHow will we meet the requirement for increased client communications?\nAn increase in the level and frequency of client communication will be the most tangible effect of MiFID II, with a requirement to provide quarterly client valuation packs.\nIn addition, all  rms will also be required to inform clients, within 24 hours, if the overall value of the portfolio, as evaluated at the beginning of each reporting period, depreciates by 10% and, thereafter, at multiples of 10%.\nWe are fully committed to making sure that this increase in communication has a bene cial impact on clients. We are in the process of streamlining the noti cation processes that will be used to deliver\nthis information, and periodic reports are meanwhile available on Rathbones Online.\nShould a portfolio depreciate by more than 10% since the last valuation was produced, an email (or letter if no email exists)\nwill be sent to the client (or appointed representative) the business day following the depreciation. All clients will switch to\n "," 9\n  Regardless of Brexit negotiations, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has already committed to complying with the resulting MiFID II legislation.\nquarterly valuations from 31 March 2018 which will be despatched in the same method as clients have currently selected.\nHow will the requirement for increased transaction reporting be met?\nTo enhance market transparency and combat market abuse, MiFID II mandates all  nancial institutions to increase the amount of information they report to the London Stock Exchange (LSE) on a daily basis. This covers every transaction made on a regulated exchange.\nWhile we already hold the majority of this data for our client base, there will be a requirement to update or review data records with some clients over the next six months in order to ensure we have a National Identi er record.\nWill there be any standardising of the identi cation of market participants?\nTo further combat market abuse, MiFID II will classify all charities, trusts (excluding bare trusts) companies and pensions (excluding SIPPs) as legal entities. For reporting purposes, all entities will need to be identi ed by a Legal Entity Identi er (LEI) code.\nWe have written to the 8,000+ clients affected by this regulation to notify them of the change.\nWe will offer a free registration service for clients on our standard fee-only tariff. For clients on other tariffs, this service will be\noffered at a discounted rate of £50 plus VAT.\nFor new trusts post 3 January, we will have an LEI client instruction form as part of the account opening pack.\nHow do the rules cater for packaged retail and insurance- based investment products (PRIIPs)?\nThis is a change which only affects clients who do not use a discretionary service and who buy PRIIPs (collective funds).\nWe already send out Key Investor Information Documents (KIIDs) for some of the UCITS products we purchase. In the future we will be required to send out a Key Information Document (KID) to our clients for a wider range of products under PRIIPs prior to any purchase, e.g. VCTs and investment trusts. This will be handled by our investment managers.\nIn addition, before investing in a PRIIP, and supplementing the KID, we will provide non-discretionary clients with an ‘ex-ante’ product charges disclosure. This will show the commission (if applicable) and annual investment management fee and product charges (OCF) of that particular investment.\nWhat do the rules say about acting in the best interests of the client over the product lifecycle?\nManufacturers and distributers of products, i.e. securities or funds, must act in the\nbest interest of the client throughout the\nlifecycle of those products.\nBoth product manufacturers and distributors now need to consider ‘target market’ for new products and services, then monitor, through appropriate data, how products are being distributed in line with the target market. This will\nnot directly affect clients. For these purposes, our funds company (Rathbone Unit Trust Management) is classi ed as\na manufacturer and the discretionary investment management arm (Rathbone Investment Management) is a distributor.\nHow is research affected by MiFID II?\nMiFID II requirement\nIn future research must be paid for via a direct payment rather than via commission.\nWe have absorbed the cost of research for many years and thus are well placed to handle MiFID II research requirements.\nRathbones are committing signi cant resources to ensuring that our business and our business partners and their clients are ready for MiFID II. If you have any further questions or concerns not addressed here, we would be happy to help. We look forward to working with our valued professional advisers to make the transition as smooth as possible.\nRathbone Investment Management Limited is authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority.

From here on in, for our collective sanity, we’ll refer to these as Exchange Traded Instruments (ETIs).\nAt last count our research showed that around 90% of investments are held in open-ended funds, around 5% in cash with the remainder hanging around in the aforementioned ETIs.\nThis is despite one of the original visions of the platform market – as we seem to recall – being a brave new world, totally agnostic of investment & wrapper type. Although, we’ve all read Brave New World and it didn’t exactly turn out well for those involved.\nI digress.\nSo while there’s been a decent amount of chatter around ETF usage; particularly in the use of models to drive down overall client costs (and let’s not forget the widespread use in the D2C Robo Advice market), ETI usage  rmly remains a minority sport on advised platforms.\nOne thing we like to do at the lang cat is play detective with the information we get our paws on. While this admittedly sounds like the dullest episode of Columbo ever, it does give us some clues to work with as we try to  gure out what’s driving these trends and behaviours.\nHere’s some obvious ones to kick us off;\n• Two of the biggest three platforms in terms of assets under administration (Old Mutual Wealth and Cofunds) don’t offer access to ETIs at all and the fourth (FundsNetwork) offers a limited range. OMW and Cofunds (well, Aegon) will address ETI access via\n We think the combination of the ongoing platform market study (along with THAT data request) and asset management review is shining an almost unprecedented regulatory light on the shape of asset choice on platform, and it seems as good a chance as any that some of these issues may be  ushed out into the open.\n "," 11\n            If you’re an adviser and you’re looking to use ETIs as part of the components of your investment proposition, then all hope is not lost. Price needn’t be a barrier because there are propositions out there that mitigate trading costs.\ntheir respective migration exercises.\n• Turning to pricing, the vast majority\nof platforms bundle in fund trading\nand rebalancing activity within the\ncore platform charge. This means if you’re an adviser running a centralised investment proposition made up entirely of collectives, you have a good handle on your costs at outset.\n• Equity trading on the other hand puts the fun into ‘fundamentally different’ (Sorry). Only a handful of platforms bundle in trading irrespective of investment type (ATS, Ascentric, Raymond James & Seven IM) It’s clearly no co-incidence that these platforms run in-house dealing desks.\n• A similar number have reasonably low costs with AJ Bell (also with an in-house dealing desk), Hubwise (same) Standard Life, Praemium and Transact having low trading costs in certain circumstances.\n• Many of the remaining platforms have ETI trading charges that would make your eyes water.\nBut that’s not all, if you’re an adviser and you’re conducting a platform selection exercise, then there’s other factors to consider. The devil really is in the detail with all of this. A few things off the top of my head:\n• If you’re hitting the button and pushing several clients through the same model, do they bene t from aggregation at asset level?\n• Do ETI trading charges apply across all wrappers or are they netted off? i.e. If your client has a pension and an ISA does a rebalance trigger just the one trade across the client portfolio or one per wrapper? This differs from platform to platform and one to look out for.\n• Can the platform effectively handle\nall asset types within models? Some platforms restrict investment choice and fractional dealing is only really in its infancy.\nTaking all of that in aggregate it seems little wonder to us then that ETIs remain in the shadows when it comes to platform usage. And we’ve only really scratched the surface with our detective work. The ‘alleged’ bias towards in-house asset managers and the fact that end to end processes on platforms are far\nmore geared towards fund usage (think fund research tools and risk pro ling) are other factors that demand a second series worth of investigation.\nIn the meantime, if you’re an adviser and you’re looking to use ETIs as part of the components of your investment proposition, then all hope is not lost. Price needn’t be a barrier because there are propositions out there that mitigate trading costs. Ultimately you need to ask the right questions at due diligence / platform selection stage and be open about your expected business volumes, particularly if some platforms on your shortlist offer aggregated trading.\nUltimately, we think the combination of the ongoing platform market study (along with THAT data request) and asset management review is shining an almost unprecedented regulatory light on the shape of asset choice on platform, and it seems as good a chance as any that some of these issues may be  ushed out into the open.

We de ne the medium-term as a time horizon of greater than one year but less than  ve. It can often mean investing in regions or asset classes that are unloved and unfairly misjudged by the market. Sometimes these asset classes underappreciated for the wrong reasons and present opportunities for potential returns or downside protection. Importantly, these “ugly ducklings” have tended to be cheap relative to other asset classes (i.e. represent value).\nIn the Multi-Index funds, we have identi ed\na number of these opportunities in our hunt for ‘mid-risk’ assets; assets with a reasonable equity beta but comparatively lower volatility. European infrastructure and global real estate investment trusts (REITs) are just a few of the ‘ugly ducklings’ we are currently favouring in the portfolios.\nUgly Duckling #1: European utilities\nRather than use listed infrastructure, we prefer to gain exposure through the European utilities sector. Much of the returns from European infrastructure can be attributed to utilities making it a decent proxy for the asset class and one that we can access through cost-effective futures. Since the global  nancial crisis, utilities have signi cantly\nunderperformed the rest of the European market and repelled a large number of potential investors with it. However, we believe that there are a number of reasons why this asset class should be given a second look by asset allocators.\nAfter a perfect environment between 2003 and 2008 came the perfect storm. Falling power prices, a carbon price collapse, weak balance sheets and political headwinds combined to drag down the sector’s performance. Yet sentiment is  nally improving. In a sector ripe for consolidation we see positive signs for increasing capital expenditure, improving earnings, improved regulatory environment and potential bene ts of technological advancements including smart grids and electric vehicles.\nEuropean utilities are particularly attractive from a valuation perspective relative to other\nEuropean equity sectors. As can be seen in the chart above, utilities are amongst the highest dividend yielding sectors and, importantly, offer a stable source of in ation-linked cash  ows. This valuation case has been driven by strong underperformance of utilities since 2008 relative to the wider European market as can be seen by the chart on the right above. Sentiment is slowly improving and performance relative to European equities has been strong but, as is often the case with a medium-term view, that is driven\nby valuation.\nUgly Duckling #2: Global REITs\nReal estate investment trusts (REITs) are\na strong way to gain property exposure without investing in property directly. REITs are listed companies managing commercial (for example of ce space, shopping centres) and sometimes residential property, offering investors a stake in the real estate market, often with increased liquidity compared to direct ‘bricks and mortar’ funds\nEuropean infrastructure - Deep value\nSource: BAML, as at August 2017\n  Europeaninfrastructure-Highdividend yield\nSource: BAML, as at August 2017\n "," 13\n Global real estate and other asset classes\nSource: Bloomberg L.P.,LGIM.

Data from January 1990 to June 2016.\n Source: LGIM\nIdentifying mid-risk assets\n  Ugly ducklings can be found right across the investment spectrum, however, over the last year in particular the most interesting ideas have been found in the mid-risk asset area.\n                                 A good source of income and long-term capital growth potential, real estate companies generate returns from their underlying property holdings and rent payments. We have a constructive outlook on the asset\nclass and after having underperformed\nthe wider equity markets this past year\nthey now look even more attractive. From\na valuation perspective US REITs look particularly attractive – and should bene t from structurally lower yields and above trend economic growth. Importantly, just like all views with a medium-term time horizon taken with a value perspective, the market can often take time to reward investors therefore we are willing to be patient.\nHolding REITs also provides a diversi cation bene t to the portfolio when compared to equities. Over time, the correlation between REITs and equities weakens and performance begins to more closely mirror that of direct property investments as you can see from the chart on the top right.\nMid-risk assets\nUgly ducklings can be found right across the investment spectrum, however, over the last year in particular the most interesting ideas have been found in the mid-risk asset area.\nBut what exactly are mid-risk assets? These are asset classes that sit in the middle of the spectrum of risk in terms of asset classes as per the  gure on the bottom right.\nWe are in a low volatility environment. Yet,\nas we get to the end of the cycle, we would expect the volatility of asset classes to start to increase. Allocating to mid-risk assets should\nin theory provide less downside risk than traditional equities while still providing decent upside potential when experiencing single-digit returns for equity markets.\nFuture swans\nIn building a global multi-asset portfolio the key determinant of risk, and therefore returns, is going to be asset allocation. If anything, the ability to be active in asset allocation and seeking out future swans is more important now than it has ever been. With central banks starting to think about shrinking their balance sheets, the uncertainty from the aftermath of the global  nancial crisis still has far-reaching effects. Being able to react to a changing environment and dynamically adjust asset allocation will be crucial for multi-asset funds to manage overall risk but also to deliver attractive returns.\nThis is not a consumer advertisement.

As we anticipated in our last SIPP Financial Stability report, not everyone made it to the other\nside in one piece.\n• European Pensions Management went bust in June 2016. It was then acquired by Suffolk Life, which is part of Curtis Banks Group.\n• Brooklands Pensions entered into administration and accepted a buyout deal from Heritage Pensions.\n• London & Colonial has been acquired by Isle of Man based  nancial services business STM Group.\n• Rowanmoor was acquired by Embark Group.\n• Wensley Mackay was acquired by platform provider Praemium.\n• Mattioli Woods acquired MC Trustees.\nLike a raging storm that wreaks havoc with everything in its path, PS14/12 orchestrated the demise of ‘mom and pop’ SIPP operators.\nMany SIPP providers made it to the other side, even if not unscathed. So how life for providers who survived?\nThe latest SIPP Financial Stability Guide\nfor 2017, titled ‘Life After PS14/12’* sheds some light on this. Written in conjunction\nwith industry veteran John Moret, the report benchmarks the top 16 bespoke SIPP providers, who together account for more than 90% of the non-insured bespoke SIPP market.\nHere are some of the key themes;\nThe SIPP industry unravelling is under the regulatory spotlight.\nFor years, many SIPP operators have effectively  own under the regulatory radar. The sector was riddled with sub-scale providers, under investment in technology, poor service standards, and management oversight. A year after PS14/12, this appears to be changing.\nThere are indications that some providers\nare still having a dif cult time post-PS14/12. At least three SIPP providers have failed the Financial Conduct Authority capital adequacy requirements and 14  rms wrongly reported their capital to the regulator.\nThe impact of the FCA crackdown on providers’ retained interest is starting to feed through to the bottom-line. However, many providers are still overly reliant on interest margins.\nFor instance, Curtis Banks banked £4.5 million revenue in interest margins from clients’ assets, accounting for 64% of its pre-tax pro t in 2016.\nIn the consultation paper CP15/30, the FCA stated that some providers were not following the rules on interest margin disclosure and thus charges comparisons between providers could be misleading. Subsequently, in PS 16/12, the FCA con rmed that from April 2017 SIPP retained interest charges should be included in projections and charges information.\nCollectively, SIPP providers reported a total pre-tax pro t of £40.3 million on their revenue of £227 million, a pro t margin of 18% for\nthe year ending 2016. Revenue grew by 8.6% and pre-tax pro ts by 3.9%, compared to the previous year.\n* See https:// nalytiq.co.uk/product/sipp- nancial-stability-guide/\n "," 15\n  For years, many SIPP operators have effectively  own under the regulatory radar. The sector was riddled with sub-scale providers, under investment in technology, poor service standards, and management oversight.\nA year after PS14/12, this appears to be changing.\n We’re beginning to see signs that pro t margin is stabilising at just below the 20% mark\nand is unlikely to return to the circa 30% we witnessed pre-2013.\n• Potential legal claims in relation to poor investment advice and failed investments pose risks to some providers.\nThere is growing concern about the possible impact on SIPP providers of legal claims relating to failed or poorly performing investments.\nOne example of a problematic investment that has entered the public domain is Elysian Fuels. James Hay has con rmed that some of its clients have invested a total of £55 million in this investment and it is known that several other SIPP providers have clients holding this investment. Close to £200 million may have been invested via SIPPs into Elysian Fuels which suggests there could be over 2,000 investors involved.\nWhat of course is unknown is the extent of the SIPP provider liability and the redress that may be required. What is clear is that the\nrisk posed to some providers as a result of potential legal claims is a ticking time bomb with severe implications.\nwww. nalytiq.co.uk www.twitter.com AbrahamOnMoney abraham@ nalytiq.co.uk\n  Collectively, SIPP providers reported a total pre-tax pro t of £40.3 million on their revenue of £227 million, a pro t margin\nof 18% for the year ending 2016.

And this is growing in importance post pension freedoms - the “saving up” and “drawing down” stages\nare likely to require different thinking and approaches.\nInput and guidance\nBefore creating or refreshing your CIP there is some core reading that you should undertake:\n• FCA TR16/1 Assessing suitability: Research and due diligence of products and services\n• FCA Factsheet 012: Platforms: using fund\nsupermarkets and wraps\n• And of course, input and guidance available from your compliance  rm\nMany product providers / paraplanners will also have templates and support documentation that will assist.\nInvestment committee role – challenge the status quo bias\nOne key element of any CIP is the documentation, recording and challenge that it requires.\nSmaller  rms will  nd that simple minute- taking and diarising reviews will be suf cient.\nLarger  rms and those with discretionary permissions will need more formal reporting and MI.\nOne important role that an Investment Committee can ful l is to challenge the CIP and its assumptions / outputs.

External compliance or consultant support may be useful to bring in fresh ideas and thinking.\nSimple agendas, well thought out reports and good minute taking will provide for quality meetings, discussion and reporting. Bringing in your preferred managers or platforms\nto present (against your agenda) may also provide quality oversight.\nIn some smaller  rms that I have worked with, a quarterly committee that rotates the agenda around key areas has worked well:\nQ1. The CIP\nQ2. Platform DDQ\nQ3. Managers and DFMs\nQ4.

Outsourcing to a narrow range of appropriate solutions may achieve this for smaller  rms, whereas larger  rms may believe that they can achieve these gains by running internal processes with scale.\n• Capital / ICAAP – going down the route of having discretionary permissions will create substantial capital, compliance and recruitment issues.\n2.

Do you want to be able to explain to clients the details of each portfolio holding?\n• Costs – what are the time and  nancial costs of conducting this work in house vs outsourcing?\nNext steps\nHopefully this provides some food for thought in developing your CIP, if you would like some further thoughts and templates please do contact me.\nIn the next article we look at due diligence and screening processes and what sort of MI you might need / want to gather.\nEmail: david.norman@tc nvestment.com\n Insource and outsource\nOne key area that still creates much debate is about the decision to insource or outsource investment management.\nThere is no right answer (other than the need to evidence good outcomes) but there are a couple of important dimensions that will need to be considered: business and investment\n1. Business\n• Ownership – there is substantial value in investment management (hence the rise of vertically integrated solutions) so a growing number of advisers wish to own that value and are creating models or extracting revenue from oversight / implementation\n• Value add –  rms will have different views on whether they want to have direct input to the investment process (e.g. fund selection) or not\n• Branding – are you happy to recommend the products of investment managers\nor would you prefer to have your own branded investment proposition (advisory or discretionary)\n 17\n","        18\n        Multi-Asset Income Investing\n  Chris Ainscough | Fund Manager | Charles Stanley\nAfter 30 years, the bond bull market may be coming to an end. Does this mean that investors should start thinking about minimising their exposure to  xed income?\nA change in direction for  xed income markets has been a long time coming. The benchmark 10-year US Treasury yield has been following a downward trajectory since the mid-eighties and now stands at around 2.3%. Given the inverse relationship between yields and price, this has been an extremely good time for bond holders.\nIt now looks as though this is all about to change, as the US prepares to act on stronger economic data and set about normalising monetary policy. In the face of further interest rate rises, it’s fair to assume that bond prices are most likely to start moving in the opposite direction.\nHowever, it’s important to remember that the end of the bull-run doesn’t mean that attractive returns are suddenly not possible when it comes to bonds. Interest rates\nwill undoubtedly go up but the journey to normalisation is going to be an extremely gradual one. The Federal Reserve will be keen to avoid a repeat of the ‘taper tantrum’ of 2013 when markets abruptly panicked in response to the Federal Reserve’s attempts to reduce the amount of money being fed into\nthe economy. What this means is that, with careful duration management, it will still be possible to capture attractive credit spreads to offset potential capital loses for a positive total return.\nIt is also important to note that, outside of the UK, the world is experiencing a relatively benign in ationary environment. The US,\nin particular, has been struggling to hit the Federal Reserve’s 2% target for quite some time. Core in ation in the Eurozone is also lagging the central bank’s 2% target. Against this backdrop, real returns are still eminently possible to achieve.\nInvestors who are concerned about the outlook for  xed income may want to consider adopting a multi-asset approach. Spreading your portfolio across a range of asset classes and underlying securities is a sensible way to reduce volatility while bene ting from the different risk and reward pro les available.\nFor example, an equity income fund managed by one provider, and a separate bond income fund managed by a second provider are\nboth restricted to a narrow opportunity\nset. This limits the ability of a manager to construct “natural hedges” or to switch between securities from the same issuer to\n Outside of the UK, the world is experiencing a relatively benign in ationary environment.

Multi-asset solutions remove these inef ciencies.\n‘Natural hedges’ give portfolios the edge\nwhen it comes to adapting to new economic environment. They can be constructed by mixing shares that typically bene t from interest rate rises, such as  nancials, with  xed income instruments that move in the opposite direction when rates rise. In a rising rate environment, you will lose some capital from your bonds but hope to make some up from the  nancials where rising net interest margins feed through to higher pro tability and share price appreciation. Bonds can still represent a critical component of a portfolio.\nMoving around the capital structure of an issuer also requires  xed income exposure and allows you to capture any deviations from fair value in the market. If an equity increases in value rapidly then the dividend yield will likely fall as dividend growth struggles to keep up. This might be the time to look to the issuer’s debt where there may be a relatively attractive credit spread to be captured whilst locking in the gains on the equity.\nIt’s also worth noting that multi-asset investing opens the door to alternative sources of income that would otherwise be inaccessible to retail investors. There are a number of investment trusts out there\nthat allow investors access to sectors that\nare typically dif cult to invest in due to the skillsets or scale required. Infrastructure is a good example of this and also offers highly forecastable cash  ows that can provide a reliable income stream to long term investors.\nAnother example would be preference shares which sit between common stock and debt within the capital structure whilst paying\na  xed dividend. These securities tend to\nbe fairly illiquid but an attractive illiquidity premium can be achieved when stock does trade.\nThe bull-run may soon be over for bonds but to us that just means a normalisation of future returns from the abnormal level we have witnessed in recent years. The US economy\nis slowly starting to gain momentum and\nthe Federal Reserve is getting increasingly comfortable with the idea of raising interest rates, although we expect any increases to\nbe small and gradual. Other central banks\nmay be a number of years behind but the US still exerts a signi cant gravitational pull on global sovereign yields. Typically, that drives bond prices down and turns a bull market into a bear. The end of the run will not however make bonds a fundamentally bad option\nand real returns are still possible in a benign in ation environment. Multi-asset funds utilise bonds as part of a balanced strategy that is capable of adapting to a new economic environment with ease.\nNothing in this article should be construed as personal advice based on your circumstances.

The foundation of most of the current asset allocation processes was set in the 1960s with the advent of modern portfolio theory.\nWe are aware of the academic theory behind the solutions and have built our approach to take account of the input from all these complex systems as well as adding in information from managers, our own research and some practical understanding of how best to offer a solution that can be realistically maintained over time.\nWe recognise that many such systems are based on historic data and therefore there is a need to add in forward-looking information that is also quanti able within certain parameters and con dence rates.\nOur Approach\nOur approach to the construction of portfolios begins with asset allocation. Linking the asset allocation to the risk pro le is intended to be a straightforward approach and does not attempt to provide an active asset allocation process, or one aimed at maximising returns by market timing. Our approach produces a more consistent process\nwhich is easily explained by the adviser and easily understood by the client.\nWe work to combine funds to form a portfolio within a given risk pro le. We believe we can do this by setting parameters for each risk pro le and then building the portfolio to sit within those parameters. This can only really work over the longer term however, and we do not expect to change portfolios based on shorter term information.\nThe RSMR Rfolios\nWe provide asset allocations and portfolios that match the risk pro les used by advisory  rms, plus we have a suite of model portfolios - the RSMR Rfolios.\nOur approach to determining asset allocation is intended to be relatively simple and strategic in nature, not looking to constantly change positioning and attempting to time market changes, as we feel this is a near- impossible task. Our approach produces\na more consistent process that is easily explained by the adviser and understood by investors.\nStrategic Asset Allocation\nThe methodology for building asset allocations is based around three core processes. The  rst is to construct our\nglobal asset allocation framework, which establishes our medium- to long-term strategic allocations to the major asset classes required within portfolios. Secondly, these allocations may be adjusted on a tactical basis to take account of shorter-term factors that are not re ected in longer-term performance, volatility and correlation  gures. Finally, and of equal importance, we may adjust these allocations to account for speci c client requirements.\nFor the RSMR Rfolios we have constructed 7 active and 7 passive strategic asset allocations that provide incremental increases in volatility over the medium to\n  ","21\n   A deep understanding of funds, including their behaviour in different market conditions and inherent style biases, means we can combine appropriate funds and select funds to represent our market and asset class views.\nlong term, primarily through an adjustment to the Equities and Fixed Interest allocations. There is also one SRI themed portfolio to complete the set.\nThe strategic asset allocation positioning takes into account data from various sources in order that the view is not biased to internal information or in uences.\nWithin each of the four major asset classes we may break them down further as follows:\n• Equities – Region / sector\n• Fixed Interest – Government / Index-\nLinked / Investment Grade Corporate /\nHigh Yield / Emerging Market Debt\n• Property – UK direct commercial /\nequities, including REITs\n• Cash\nFor the RSMR Rfolios we have selected\nsix major asset class categories; Cash, Fixed Interest, UK Equities, International Equities, Property and Absolute Return. As stated earlier, the asset allocations provide incremental increases in volatility over the medium to long-term primarily through adjustments to the Equities and Fixed Interest weighting. The broad categories of Fixed Interest, International Equities and Absolute Return provide the portfolios with the  exibility to allocate to different sub-asset classes on both a strategic and tactical basis.\nAt the outset, we consider the various rates of return we expect from different asset classes over the long term and based on a normal economic cycle. These rates are indicated below and represent our longer term view of returns for the core asset classes:\nTactical Asset Allocation\nAt a portfolio level, the ability to tactically allocate away from the central strategic asset allocations is based more on subjective judgement of the current position of asset classes relative to the medium to long term where we consider three main factors within our analysis – valuations, fundamentals & sentiment.\nFund Selection\nPortfolio construction combines the strategic and tactical asset allocation process with our fund selection process. The general aim is\nto provide a sensible combination of asset classes and funds for the given risk pro le and the overall portfolio objectives.\nWithin a portfolio context, fund selection generally aims to combine funds within\nasset classes to provide suf cient, but not excessive, diversi cation plus a balance of investment styles and market capitalisation exposure that are appropriate for the risk pro le. Fund selection can also be used to implement tactical asset allocation views and to tilt portfolios towards more attractive asset class, investment styles and market capitalisations whilst remaining cognisant of the medium to long term.\nA deep understanding of funds, including their behaviour in different market conditions and inherent style biases, means we can combine appropriate funds and select funds to represent our market and asset class views.\nThe Rfolios are available as advisory or discretionary.

Emerging economies in particular have the potential to bene t from the widespread encouraging economic signs we have been seeing of late.\nThere are risks to be aware of however. Most central banks are now looking to gradually ‘tighten’ monetary policy, reducing quantitative easing (QE) and slowly raising interest rates, with the US Federal Reserve (Fed) leading\nthe way. This has the potential to make bond markets slightly more volatile. We saw this in September when the Bank of England warned of a sooner-than-expected rate rise.\nSeptember saw a further big announcement from the Fed, when they laid out plans for the reduction of their QE programme. Central bank policy has supported stock markets for a long time now by providing cheap money to  nancial institutions, almost becoming the norm. This move by the Fed could mark the reversal of loose monetary policy, with other central banks likely to follow suit over time.\nWe think markets may begin to focus more on company fundamentals and not central banks. This is in an environment which should generate a wider spread between the winners and losers in stock markets.\nUK economy – mixed prospects\nIn the UK the economic outlook remains mixed. Recent company earnings have\nbeen encouraging and the strength of the global economy is clearly good for globally- exposed UK companies, especially early-cycle sectors such as airlines, recruiters and select industrials.\nBut while the economy as a whole has not gone into recession, growth is slow. This is\nin contrast to other world markets, with\nthe unknowns around Brexit undoubtedly a factor. The only certainty with Brexit is that the whole process is going to take a lot longer than envisioned.\nConsumer credit has also been growing much faster than household incomes in recent years, with car  nance having seen some of the fastest expansion. This is something the Bank of England is pushing credit providers to increase safeguards against with its latest measures.\nAs we know from past experiences, the risk to the wider economy of rising consumer credit is if we see shocks to the system, such as rises in interest rates. The probability of a rate rise is certainly high but the pace of any increases is likely to be slow and contained under a lower “ceiling”. While it does feel as though UK consumers are in a fairly fragile position, if rates stay relatively low and there are no major shocks, then we should at least “muddle” through. But this is not really something to shout about versus other economies.\nEurope buoyed\nIn Europe, Angela Merkel remaining as German Chancellor after September’s election has kept con dence up in the eurozone. The economic outlook for the region is encouraging, supporting European stock markets, while election risk from the beginning of the year is dissipating. Economic data continues to improve, while earnings are strengthening, and on a relative basis stocks are not particularly expensive.\n ","23\n   While the economy as a whole has not gone into recession, growth is slow. This is in contrast to other world markets, with the unknowns around Brexit undoubtedly a factor. The only certainty with Brexit is that the whole process is going to take a lot longer than envisioned.\nUS policy reform stalls\nSome economic signs in the US also continue to strengthen. However, continually low wage growth is impacting consumer con dence. There is also increasing uncertainty around the President’s  scal stimulus plans, including increased infrastructure spending and tax cuts. Although the President laid out grand plans that would have given a signi cant boost to companies, there has been a failure so far to get these approved and implemented.\nWhile economic growth is solid, company earnings are more questionable. On top of this, stocks look expensive compared to developed market peers.\nJapan in focus\nWe think Japanese stocks offer better relative value. We believe there is potential for rising wage growth, which would support future economic growth. It is also clear that some of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s policies since his election in 2012 are having an effect. Core in ation, excluding energy and food, has been positive and stable since the summer\nof 2015. Unemployment continues to fall as the number of jobs outweighs applicants, something that has been improving since the  nancial crisis. At the same time business sentiment remains positive, suggesting con dence of future growth.\nCorporate governance, which has been\npoor historically in Japan, is improving. Employment reforms to bring more women into the workplace are also long-term projects which should bene t the Japanese economy by providing a new source of labour and indeed consumer.\nJapanese companies have been able to deliver solid positive earnings growth, with more positive news than negative surprises across a wide range of sectors and industries. Improving corporate earnings have been supportive of share prices in recent months but they still represent reasonable value compared to other global markets.\nSo against this largely positive backdrop, what are the main risks? In ation increasing faster than targeted could force the major central banks to raise interest rates quicker than expected.\nThis has the potential to upset markets, in particular bonds.

Liontrust’s Head of Multi-Asset John Husselbee – who runs the FP Verbatim Growth funds – considers why current political volatility is not showing up in markets.\nVolatility – or more accurately the current lack of it – is becoming an increasingly important subject for investors, with the so-called Fear index in the US (known as the Vix) sitting at all-time lows.\nThe index has remained around the 10 level for much of this year, hovering just above the record low of 9.31 reached on 22 December 1993. To put these  gures in context, the average level since the Vix launched in 1990 has been 19.5 and the high, in October 2008 as the global  nancial crisis began to unfold, was above 80.\nCommentators have suggested several reasons for such lows, including market distortion created by the rise of passive strategies, widespread central bank intervention over recent years and falling correlations between individual stocks.\nMore importantly, thinking is now turning to whether the prevailing low volatility signals a spike to come and perhaps a bear market along with it. There is also increasing discussion about what might spark such a\npick up, with interest rate rises in the US,\na chaotic UK general election in May and even nuclear sabre rattling between the US and North Korea only prompting short-term blips.\nThe end of loose monetary policy may be\na contender to cause a sustained rise in the Vix and September  nally gave us some certainty on this front, at least as far as the US Federal Reserve is concerned. The Bank started cutting its $4.5 trillion balance sheet in October, initially by $10bn per month, and Chair Janet Yellen said the normalisation process would be gradual and predictable\nin a clear attempt to stave off any rise in volatility.\nAccording to recent press articles, several multi-asset managers are adding protection to portfolios in a bid to hedge against future risks, suggesting they believe low volatility signals investor complacency. While I understand this thinking, basic supply/ demand suggests that if portfolio protection is popular at present, it will also become\nincreasingly expensive.\nWe continue to stress our view that intermittent corrections of 5% to 10% are a common and necessary function of healthy markets and suggest we are overdue such\na pullback. Discounting any kind of black swan event, however, we are not expecting a bear market to develop: there is plenty\nof political risk out there and equities are expensive but they remain supported while dividend yields continue to outstrip those available from bonds.\nAnyone familiar with our approach knows we are patient, long-term investors and we believe current concerns about a potential spike in volatility reinforce the case for properly diversi ed, risk targeted portfolios.\nTaking a wider view, we question current assumptions that low volatility, if taken as\na sign of complacency, should be seen as\nan automatic sell signal. The last sustained bull run stretched for 12 years, from 1987 to 1999, during which the FTSE 100 rose close to 340%. In the current post-2009 run, the\n ","          25\n                                                                                     Market volatility will always be a concern – whatever the current level – but using risk-targeted funds means clients can take on as much or as little as their pro le dictates.\nindex is up around 113% in capital growth to late October 2017, so no one can claim we are in a situation without precedent, at least when it comes to rising markets.\nResearch shows low volatility can persist for a long time and while sometimes followed by a bear market, it is far from a reliable signal. Also, where low volatility has led to strong market falls, there has typically been a gradual rise in volatility before the downturn sets in.\nWith the twin shocks of the vote for Brexit and the election of Donald Trump last year and a heavy year of election activity in 2017, no one can deny we are in an era of high political volatility and many have understandably asked why this has not fed through into stock markets.\nA  rst point to make is that in contrast to previous episodes of political uncertainty (2008 and 2011-12), earnings growth and measures of liquidity have improved over recent months.\nWe also agree with the idea that a new form of lower-growth economic stability has emerged in recent years – now spreading from the US and UK into the eurozone. This can explain much of the fall in volatility, with many companies able to achieve robust earnings growth despite little in the way of\neconomic growth.\nLooking at previous spells of low volatility, it is possible to draw certain conclusions: they typically follow a recession, are de ned by relative economic stability and are followed by periods of exuberance.\nSome might argue we have already seen plenty of exuberance – with markets hitting record highs in recent months – but with many commentators now realistically asking if the FTSE 100 might breach 8000, we are in for a fascinating 2018 and beyond.\nA key point to note for the Verbatim Growth funds is that while volatility is central, we are focused on individuals’ risk tolerance rather than concentrating on overall market  uctuations.\nSomeone’s best investment can only be determined by personal circumstances, which means the era of so-called one size  ts all funds – particularly in the multi- manager space – may be coming to an end. Consumers are demanding greater customisation in a range of  elds, from trainers to cars, and our range of volatility- targeted funds allows advisers to select the most appropriate based on a client’s risk tolerance.\nSome risk will always be necessary to achieve returns but taking on too much at the wrong\npoint in life could potentially be catastrophic for  nancial health. Market volatility will always be a concern – whatever the current level – but using risk-targeted funds means clients can take on as much or as little as their pro le dictates.\nDisclaimer:\n• This content contains information and analysis that is believed\nto be accurate at the date of publication but is subject to change without notice.Whilst care has been taken in compiling this content, no representation or warranty, express or implied, is made by Liontrust as to its accuracy or completeness.

It is easy to forget now how scary that crisis appeared with banks crashing,  nancial markets plummeting and unemployment rising sharply. But it could have been far worse without the prompt action of central banks around the world. They injected massive amounts of money into the  nancial system, buying up assets through newly-created money, a process known as Quantitative Easing (QE), to stimulate economic activity.\nShock and awe\nThe scale of the monetary  repower deployed by global central banks over the past 10\nyears is truly breathtaking. Altogether around $10 trillion has been pumped into  nancial markets, equivalent to almost four times the size of the UK’s economy in 20161. As a result, the Bank of Japan now owns 71 per cent of\nits local Exchange Traded Funds’ market and over 40 per cent of local government bonds2&3. Meanwhile, the Bank of England holds around £435 billion of UK government bonds, or nearly one-third of all gilts outstanding4&5.\nWithout these measures the global economy could have entered a slump to rival the Great Depression. But the sheer weight of the wall of money that has crashed into  nancial markets has also increased the price of  nancial assets. Stocks and bonds around the world have\nsoared in value. Moreover, investors have\nbeen forced into riskier and riskier parts of the market. So as the price of government bonds rose, investors moved into investment grade corporate bonds. When those too rose in value, high yield bonds became a target. When they became expensive, investors sought out equities. In effect the rising tide of QE  oated all boats, with  nancial assets rising in value almost irrespective of their individual merits or risk pro le.\nHowever, we now believe this era of extraordinary central bank activity is coming to an end. The process is most advanced in the US, where the economic recovery from the GFC has also been the strongest in the developed world. The Federal Reserve’s (the Fed) programme of asset purchases ceased in 2014, while the Fed also began to increase\ninterest rates at the end of 2015. As the global economy strengthens, and we believe it will expand by around 3.5 per cent this year, the fastest rate of increase since 2011, other central banks are becoming con dent that they too can begin to scale back and eventually withdraw their extraordinary policies.\nThe return of active management\nThis turning point will have signi cant implications for investors. We don’t believe markets will sell off but we do think that investors will have to become much more discerning about which assets they buy. They will have to focus on the fundamental drivers of an asset price rather than simply relying on a  ood of central bank money to lift asset prices higher. So factors, such as the outlook for in ation, interest rates, corporate earnings,\no\n  ","        ours\n29\n Investors in MAF funds bene t not just from our ability to determine which region of the globe offers the best prospects, but also which sector could do best in that region, as well as our expertise in gaining exposure in a way that aims to maximise returns.\nor the quality of a company’s management, will once again become crucial in determining whether a stock or bond offers good value. Investors will have to take care over which assets they are exposed to, as well as which geographical regions, sectors and individual stocks they choose to invest in.\nThis return to the “normal” rules of investing should create fertile ground for the Aviva Investors’ range of Multi-asset funds (MAF). We can exploit the insights provided by\nour economists and analysts to determine which assets, regions, sectors and stocks are best placed to perform strongly in this new environment, and which to avoid.\nTo give an example, we currently\nfavour European equities, which have underperformed global markets in recent years but should now bene t from the euro-zone’s improving economic outlook. Moreover, within Europe we have identi ed banks as offering the best prospects. They offer good value and are likely to bene t disproportionately from a pick up in economic\ngrowth in the region. But rather than simply investing directly in European banking stocks, we have bought instruments called futures, which allow us to pro t from an increase in the share price of European banks. Futures are, however, less costly than buying shares.\nSo investors in MAF funds bene t not just from our ability to determine which region of the globe offers the best prospects, but also which sector could do best in that region, as well as our expertise in gaining exposure in a way that aims to maximise returns.\n1 Yardeni Research: Global Economic Brie ng: Central Bank Balance Sheets, August 2017 https://www.yardeni.com/pub/peacockfedecbassets.pdf\n2 Bloomberg, 19 July 2017: Japan’s Central Bank Is Distorting the Market, Bourse Chief Says https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-19/ japan-bourse-head-turns-surprise-critic-of-kuroda-etf- purchases\n3 Reuters, July 7 2017: Bank of Japan offers to buy unlimited amount of bonds to calm markets http://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-bonds- idUSKBN19S0YI\n4 Bank of England, August 2017 http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/Pages/apf/default. aspx\n5 UK Debt Management Of ce, August 2017 http://www.dmo.gov.uk/reportView.aspx?rptCode= D5E&rptName=55248374&reportpage=Market_Size\nImportant Information\nThis commentary is not an investment recommendation and should not be viewed as such.

London of ce space features prominently in Derwent’s portfolio, a segment which appears vulnerable to both structural and fundamental pressures.\nStructurally, London of ces would suffer in the event of a  nancial services exodus, but the impact may be more benign than the market has priced in. Financial services constitute\njust 30 per cent of London of ce-based employment and have accounted for a fraction of job creation over the past 30 years; over\n90 per cent of job growth during this period has been derived from professional services, creative and tech industries1.\nUK longer-let leases have produced higher total returns over the past decade due to stronger yield compression, but shorter-let portfolios have produced far superior rental growth, in part due to increased demand for  exible space. Some view the rise of  exible work space as a de ationary disrupter to London’s of ce market, but there is clearly opportunity for those companies willing to be pragmatic in adapting their leasing structures to meet evolving demand.\nUnsustainable discounts\nActivity in the direct market underpins the view that current discounts are unsustainable; where UK property companies have been selling assets, they are achieving prices well above their net asset value, suggesting that the very substantial discounts to net assets which have persisted since the referendum are catalysts for change.\nBucking the discount trend, Shaftesbury, Assura, Secure Income REIT and NewRiver REIT in my portfolios have proven resilient to wider pessimism and are trading at a premium to NAV. Of these, Shaftesbury’s broad-based portfolio in London’s West End has delivered robust performance, supported by low\ntenant turnover and high-demand – a mix of restaurants, leisure and retail – which ful ls the trend for a more complete retail ‘experience’.

He is a businessman rather than a politician so\nis generally seen as pro-business but I have always had concerns over the extent to which he can back up his promises.

Ending quantitative easing (QE) is a major\nshift in policy but it has long been signposted\nas starting in the fourth quarter of 2017 so it cannot be a surprise to anyone.\nIf people do want something Fed-related to get excited about, we would note that Yellen’s term as Chair is up in February and given her remarks on regulation and free trade at Jackson Hole in August, it remains to be seen whether she will continue in the role.\nJust as putting money into markets via QE was an experiment, taking it out is similarly without precedent and markets are waiting to see what a world without this support looks like. No one is suggesting the money will be withdrawn overnight but the slowing and end of QE has to be an important consideration for investors over the coming months.\nChina – a harder landing than feared for the global  oor?\nLike most of the rest of the world, China indulged in QE in the wake of the  nancial crisis and this has helped to keep the country’s growth in the 6% to 7% range while the US\nstruggles along at 2%. Many economists believe China’s growth has kept a  oor under the global economy but concerns are growing about the country’s debt burden.\nA key driver behind this growing concern was Moody’s relegating China’s debt from Aa3 to A1 earlier this year – the  rst downgrade in 30 years - citing concerns about the country’s  nancial system and economy.\nWith credit growth routinely outstripping\nGDP in recent years, we felt this downgrade was overdue and fell into the market noise category rather than signalling any kind of major economic shift. That said, China is looking to move to more sustainable growth – mid\nsingle digits as opposed to the 10%-plus of recent memory – and excessive leverage is one potential hurdle for such a soft landing.\nChina has been tightening policy for some\ntime, partly via  scal means (such as property constraints) and partly via monetary means (raising the costs of  nance through various channels). This aims to address pockets of excess while not derailing the recovery in growth,\nand so far it appears to have been successful. Aggressive deleveraging seems unlikely as this might pose risks to the  nancial system: if successful, reducing debt is likely to be a multi- year project.\nChina clearly has some issues to deal with to ensure its economic stability; in that, however, given the current climate, it can hardly be said to be alone.\nWhat are the chances of the above triggers occurring? I have said many times that I do not have a crystal ball and no one can accurately predict the future. We are long-term investors who believe in diversi cation, patience and building portfolios to meet the volatility targets\nthat our investors expect us to achieve. The art of our approach is how to balance this with being alert to the threats and opportunities created by the potential triggers outlined in this article.\nTo  nd out more about Liontrust and the Multi- Asset service, please visit liontrust.co.uk/multiasset\n China clearly has some issues to deal with to ensure its economic stability; in that, however, given the current climate, it can hardly be said to be alone.\n  ","  34\n Extraordinary times\n Paul Flood | Fund Manager | BNY Mellon\nNewton’s1 Paul Flood considers why, in spite of all the talk of policy ‘normalisation’, we’re still living through an era of unprecedented central bank manipulation\nBalance sheet bonanza\nRecent commentary has been about an end to quantitative easing (QE), yet the investment backdrop remains unprecedented, says Newton’s Paul Flood: even if central banks do begin to wind down their balance sheets, they will likely remain the backstop for the world’s economy for years to come.\nAdded together, the balance sheets of the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve account for some US$14.4 trillion in assets. To put this in some kind of context, the same four banks’ combined balance sheets stood at just US$2.2 trillion as of the 1 January 19992. That equates to a 650% rise in less than two decades.\nSays Flood: “This is not capitalism as we know it: It’s manipulation. The sheer scale of central bank intervention has been extraordinary. Even if QE were to stop tomorrow this would take decades to work through the system.”\nCount the negatives\nThe unintended consequences of this kind of central bank intervention are legion. In  xed income, for example, a full US$8.8 trillion of the world’s bonds trade continue to trade with\na negative yield. Says Flood: “This is below\nthe 2016 peak where nearly 30% of the  xed income universe was on a negative yield, but it’s still a staggering amount. Even a major sell-off in bond markets last year barely made a dent in the mountain of negative yielding debt.”\n        1 Investment Managers are appointed by BNY Mellon Investment Management EMEA Limited (BNYMIM EMEA) or af liated fund operating companies to undertake portfolio management activities in relation to contracts for products and services entered into by clients with BNYMIM EMEA or the BNY Mellon funds.\n2 Data source: Market Strategy Group, BNYM IM, Bloomberg, latest available data as at 9 August 2017.\n "," 35\n     Bond\n   10 year yield\n   US Treasury\n 2.2%\n UK Gilt\n   1.1%\n   German Bund\n  0.4%\n           Across the board\nIt’s not as if low yields are concentrated in just one part of the market either – they occur across the board. Even the most highly leveraged – therefore most risky – corporates are offering yields of only 2.5% while spreads are similarly squeezed. Says Flood: “A full 70% of investment grade bonds in Europe have a yield of less than 1% - that’s only half the in ation target. We’ve never had yields this low in corporate debt. It’s unprecedented and means there’s very little protection against any rise in in ation.\nPrice rise redux\nAnd yet, a rise in in ation is exactly\nwhat we’re facing. In the UK, Brexit had\nan impact on the retail price index but\nit’s a phenomenon that transcends local boundaries. In the US and in Germany, for example, in ation is back up to around 2%, partly due to a rebound in energy costs. Says Flood: “We’re seeing an upward trend in\nUS small business optimism, nominal wage growth and small business hiring – and in our view that argues in favour of further price increases down the line. And yet the yield\non 10-year US Treasuries is only 2.2%. It’s a stark reminder of how little protection there is out there against the ravages of in ation.”\nSource: Bloomberg, 31 July 2017\nMake the rules; don’t follow them For Flood, the potential for rising interest\nrates coupled with low and negative yields makes it all the more important that fund managers embrace a new approach to investing. Here, he points to the evolution of the multi-asset investment universe that looks beyond the traditional 60/40 equity/bond split as key. By broadening the investment horizon to areas such\nas alternatives, emerging market debt, infrastructure and renewables, he says, multi-asset funds are potentially much better placed to offer true diversi cation, and so weather the economic vagaries of a still uncertain world.\nPast performance is not a guide to future performance.\nFor Professional Clients only.

But it has become considerably more heated in recent years as investors have favoured passive funds.\nUnfortunately, this heat can produce smoke that obscures our goal as investment professionals: to give our clients the best chance of investment success. Too often, the debate is framed in a way that puts our professional egos, rather than client goals, at the centre of the conversation.\nInvesting engages this same primal impulse.

As the value of that asset subsequently rises or falls, one of those individuals will be deemed to be the winner. The other will be the loser.\nreports and annual updates. But our clients invest to  nance goals, hopes and dreams that often lie decades in the future.\nActive-passive through a client lens\nWhat if we ignored the short-term performance derby and focused instead on long-term client goals? The active-passive debate would become much less heated, much more nuanced.\nIn our view, passive investing is the starting point for clients, if for no other reason that that it’s simple and low cost, merely seeking to capture a market’s return. But active\ncan play an important role. The key is to recognise what it takes to succeed in active management over long time horizons.\nA successful active strategy depends on three critical elements:\n• Talent. To deliver long-term outperformance, a fund manager needs talent. This is a lot more than clever ideas and polished patter. It’s a strong team, a time-tested philosophy, and a\n Our egos are drawn into a competition measured in monthly factsheets, quarterly performance reports and annual updates.

When I watch a football match or game of cricket, I empathise with the euphoria of the winning team. And let me be brutally honest. This euphoria is not the sense of achievement I once felt when passing an exam. It’s about winning. It’s about vanquishing the competition.\nThe conventions of performance management crystallise this calculus in ways that can\nwork against the interests of our clients. Our industry evaluates performance relative to market benchmarks (as we should), but with a short-term focus (as we shouldn’t).

The total return of a fund consists\nof three parts – beta, factor and alpha.\nThe beta and factor components typically explain most of an investment’s return, and they can be obtained at low cost.\nOur task as investment professionals is to make sure that any additional costs are commensurate with expected alpha. A rule of thumb? The lower the cost, the better the chance for net alpha.\n• Patience. This can be a challenge, and this is where the quarterly performance derby can do so much damage. Every active manager underperforms the benchmark at one time or another. There may be occasions when this underperformance stretches over years. Does your client have the patience to sit tight through periods of relative weakness?\nReframing the debate\nThe active-passive debate has taken an unproductive turn.

This article explores these concerns. It also prompts advisers to consider mental capacity as part of personal and business protection, inheritance tax or retirement planning.\nLPAs are a special type of power of attorney (POA). Once an LPA is registered, an attorney can continue to act for a donor who’s lost\nthe mental capacity to deal with their own  nancial affairs. It’s also possible to appoint\nan attorney to deal with health and welfare matters for someone who’s lost mental capacity. If someone becomes mentally incapacitated and there’s no valid POA in place, the courts have to appoint a deputy to look after their affairs.\nAre LPAs unduly risky?\nIt appears Denzil Lush’s concerns about LPAs were prompted by the limited controls over attorneys’ actions. In contrast, deputyship orders always involve Court of Protection oversight. Deputies can only do things speci cally authorised by their deputyship order, and have to get the court’s permission\nto do anything else. If a deputy misuses funds, the estate can claim on a guarantee bond. This is a form of insurance that’s paid for out of the estate.\nThe resulting publicity might mean people choose their attorneys more carefully. Or it could lead to fewer LPAs being set up. If so, it’s important to understand that the alternative also has disadvantages. Obtaining a deputyship order is time consuming and expensive. The deputy can be heavily restricted in what they can do. Until the court order’s been granted, it’s not normally possible to access bank accounts, savings or investments. Debts can build up in the meantime – although lenders or service providers may be willing to waive associated fees and interest.\nIn addition, it’s excessive to conclude that there’s a complete lack of oversight of attorneys. Concerned family members or third parties can contact the Of ce of the Public Guardian. Resulting interventions have led to  nancially abusive attorneys being prosecuted, found guilty of theft or fraud, and imprisoned.\n A private conversation allows an adviser to establish a client’s personal wishes. Or where the worst is feared, could help uncover an abusive situation.\n ","39\n   LPAs are a special type of power of attorney (POA). Once an LPA is registered, an attorney can continue to act for a donor who’s lost the mental capacity to deal with their own  nancial affairs.\nHowever, it’s not always proved possible to recover the funds.\nThere are other safeguards, too. When someone creates an LPA, a certi cate\nprovider has to con rm they understand\nthe signi cance of this and aren’t under any pressure. LPAs must always be registered before the attorney can act. Legislation restricts attorneys’ powers to make gifts, as set out\nin the ‘Public Guardian Practice Note – Gifts’ available from www.gov.uk. The courts\nwill actually set aside any LPA provisions attempting to get around these protective restrictions. Advisers should be aware that this means an attorney always needs court permission before making signi cant gifts on a donor’s behalf, such as for inheritance tax planning. There’s also the ‘Mental Capacity Act 2005 code of practice’ available from www.gov.uk. This sets out, among other things, when the attorney is required to keep their own and the donor’s assets separate.\nConsiderations for advisers\nThe question of whether or not a client should set up an LPA could be a natural part of a wider protection conversation. Or it could come up in connection with inheritance tax planning. After all, this could become pointless if unscrupulous family or friends defraud a vulnerable client\nof their assets. In connection with pension planning, a client’s retirement income could\nbe at risk if they lose the cognitive capacity to manage their  exi-access drawdown. Business owners might also consider setting up a separate ‘business’ LPA as part of their continuation planning.\nWhere advisers are involved, they can stress the importance of choosing attorneys carefully. An attorney obviously needs to be trustworthy. They also need to be competent to deal with the donor’s  nancial affairs. Perhaps including acting on ongoing advice where there’s any complex planning in place. Family dynamics are yet another factor. If a particular family member is appointed as an attorney, what pragmatic and emotional concerns will other family members have?\nIt’s always going to be a client’s personal choice whether or not to set up an LPA.\nBut where suitable, an LPA can ensure that someone trustworthy, that the client has personally chosen, looks after their  nancial affairs if they lose the mental capacity to do this for themselves.\nMental capacity and vulnerable customers\nProcedures to support vulnerable customers, such as including relatives in conversations,\n t into the current legal approach of treating mental capacity as a continuum. The underlying assumption is that someone should\nbe as involved as possible in decisions relating to themselves, with as much appropriate support as necessary.\nHowever, there are limits to the support friends and relatives can provide. Informal supporters can’t deal with contracts or legal commitments on a vulnerable person’s behalf. Once someone’s lost the mental capacity\nto deal with their own  nancial affairs, only someone who’s legally authorised can make related decisions for them. That means either an attorney authorised by a registered LPA or a deputy operating in line with a court order.\nIn addition, people with the mental capacity\nto deal with their own  nancial affairs can\nstill be vulnerable to undue in uence. Perhaps following bereavement or because of aging. Family members may naturally want to be involved with key decisions, such as whether to make signi cant lifetime gifts as part of inheritance tax planning. However, a private conversation allows an adviser to establish a client’s personal wishes. Or where the worst is feared, could help uncover an abusive situation.\nNote: LPAs and deputyship orders apply in England and Wales, with different provision in Scotland and Northern Ireland\n ","  40\n Out of the ordinary – a business opportunity,\na moral imperative or something best avoided?\n  Andrew Wibberley | Director | Alea Risk\nInsurers are pretty terrible at segmenting their market or being able to identify whom their proposition is truly aimed at.\nMost protection products are thrown out\ninto the age 21-60 mortgage and family protection market. Sales come in where pricing or underwriting stands out (deliberately or otherwise), rather than being part of a calculated, coherent approach.\nThis generalist approach has led to overall improved processes through the focus on ef ciency and simplicity. A byproduct of this has been healthy competition between insurers, portals and underwriting engines to produce questions that multiple insurers can use to underwrite an individual.\nThere has been much less progress in improving access to insurance for people who do have signi cant medical conditions.\nIn 2017 there will have been over 250,000 people who applied for Life or CI insurance offered rated terms and over 25,000 who complete an application and were declined. Many more will have been discouraged from applying - whether due to sound advice or misplaced perception.\nThis is a large, growing and poorly served group of people. These are people who are more likely\nto really need insurance, could well be more eager purchasers and yet there is the sense of the protection industry’s feet dragging rather than people jumping to help.\nAccess - advisers\nThe failings – both real and perceived - in underwriting non standard lives is a major reason for reluctance amongst many advisers to raise the subject. Is it worth risking poisoning a good relationship with an established client to talk about their health and potentially have to tell them that they are not considered “normal” by an insurer?\nAmongst protection specialists a minority specialise in rated and declined lives. Work\ndone by the likes of Special Risks Bureau and Moneysworth stands out here for providing\na needed link between the public, charities\nand insurers. Other protection specialists like LifeSearch, FutureProof and Reassured will have specialists within their companies who can\nhelp source the best terms for people who have signi cant medical or other disclosures. The work being done here is good, but the numbers of people doing it are staggeringly small.\n I hope to see work at advisers, reinsurers and insurers moving to produce solutions that take the best of the improvements given to standard lives to improve the experience and accessibility to insurance for all in the year ahead.\n ","  41\n Most protection products are thrown out into the age 21-60 mortgage and family protection market. Sales come in where pricing or underwriting stands out (deliberately or otherwise), rather than being part of a calculated, coherent approach.\nAccess – reinsurers\nReinsurers take the majority of the mortality risk in the UK market and produce underwriting manuals that inform the decisions made by most insurers. These typically rate conditions up to about +400% before declining cover – so someone whose standard rates premium was £20 could go up to £100.\nThis limitation is somewhat arbitrary given it doesn’t take into account age, smoking status etc. This restriction also means that the most risky life insurance accepted presents a lower chance of a claim than most standard rates income protection policies.\nAccess – insurers\nInsurers pay for the medical evidence and will often restrict reinsurer guidelines further. They may believe as premiums increase people are less likely to take out cover, and so be reluctant to spend money on reports for an application that is unlikely to pay premiums even if terms are offered.\nMany insurers will therefore not seek to pursue policies over around a +200 risk – so in reality that £20 a month premium is capped at closer to £60 in much of the market.\nJust announced their intention to cease the specialist protection products that were part\nof the Partnership heritage out of the market in September this year – the pipeline closes early in 2018. This had offered a key avenue for advisers and insurers alike to refer on cases that sat outside their risk appetite, as terms of up to +1000 were considered by Just.\nMore positively this year has seen the launch of new products that explicitly target people diagnosed with speci c conditions. Royal London and The Exeter launched products where the premiums  ex each year dependent on the client’s latest medical information. This potentially allows cover to be offered to more people and at better terms. Critically it also allows marketing and the application process to be much more empathetic to the individuals going through it.\n80% of business is now written without any medical evidence or manual underwriting. Where evidence is truly needed the prospect of paying over £100 and waiting weeks or months is dif cult to justify in many business models.\nThe thrust to democratise ownership and use of medical data potentially becomes transformative here.With costs dramatically reduced insurers should soon push (and be pushed) harder to do more for people with increased risk as acquisition costs reduce signi cantly.\nJoining up the dots\nThere is a current dif culty that lies beneath many of the stats that insurers commandeer for their marketing purposes from charities.\nThis point was bought home at the Cover conference this year, where a highlight was\na talk given by a British Heart Foundation representative in his mid 40s who had survived multiple heart operations since his  rst day alive. The reality that he would never have\nbeen able to get any protection insurance was overlooked by many in the audience in the hurry to note down the stats that “1 in 4 get x in their lifetime” and 1 in 7 get y by 65”...\nThis is particularly true for income protection, where any suggestion of joint pain or mental illness can be crudely excluded from the policy.\nIf we are to use these numbers then we should have the decency to do all we can to start from a position of yes, and only exclude those lives who are truly uninsurable rather than merely inconvenient to an ever more streamlined operating model.\nI hope to see work at advisers, reinsurers and insurers moving to produce solutions that take the best of the improvements given to standard lives to improve the experience and accessibility to insurance for all in the year ahead.\n ","  42\n  Adding certainty to retirement outcomes\n Rosie Gilbert | Investment Governance and Flexible Guarantee Product Manager - Retirement Solutions | LV=\nInvestment returns are likely to be one of the most critical factors in determining the level of sustainable income available to your clients in retirement.\n   10 year cumulative performance\nStockmarket linked investments offer the potential for superior growth but, as we know, they also bring the risk of underperformance – and, with it, a corresponding negative impact on planned retirement outcomes.\nThe signi cant increase in the number\nof clients opting for drawdown income solutions instead of lifetime annuities since\nthe introduction of the pension freedom\nand choice reforms has served to underline\nthe continued importance of investment performance. Drawdown means that the potential impacts of adverse market conditions are no longer just a worry for the accumulation phase. Sequence of returns risk means that investment performance can continue to be a worry into the decumulation phase.\nWithdrawing income at an inopportune time can have a devastating impact on the ability of an investment to sustain a chosen level of income, and can signi cantly increase the ‘risk of ruin’. The prospect of running out of money, and being unable to meet essential needs,\nis not an attractive reward for clients after a lifetime of work and saving.\nThe challenge for the adviser is to identify a solution that can provide the prospect of a reasonable level of growth to help support a client’s income requirements, while reducing, or managing out, the risk of exhausting the pension pot earlier than planned.\nThe diversi cation offered by multi – asset investment funds can help reduce these risks but this isn’t always suf cient to satisfy the needs or attitudes towards investment risk of every client.\nThese 2 charts help to illustrate the background to the challenge. The investments selected are simply for example purposes.\nBoth charts look at the total returns achieved by the average fund in the ABI Pension Mixed Investments 40-85% Shares sector and the ABI Pension UK All Companies sector over the 10 calendar years from 1st January 2007 to 31st December 2016.\nThe  rst chart shows cumulative total returns of over 60% for both funds, which suggests a comfortable average return of around 6% a year over the 10 year period.\nDelving deeper, the second chart looks at how this overall performance was achieved and paints a potentially less rosy picture. The pattern of growth is not consistent and had a client been using drawdown to provide regular income withdrawals over the past 10 years, there were occasions when they could have depleted their investment by more than was planned in order to achieve the required level of income – with potentially serious conRsolleing qBar uChaert nces.\nPast performance is not a reliable guide to the future.\nData provided by FE.

Osborne certainly dealt\nwith that unappealing prospect, setting\noff a transformation in how pensions are managed and advised on. The regulator\nhas recently launched the Consultation Paper CP 17/16 on pension transfers and although this has not yet become Final Guidance, the industry seems to be taking its recommendations as read. The specialist  rms that provided the critical yield calculations that previously underpinned transfer recommendations, will now have to assist advisers to calculate an ‘Appropriate Pension Transfer Analysis’ (APTA for short).\nThe adviser now has to take back responsibility (if they had any doubt) for\nthe recommendation. Therefore, no single calculation, critical yield or otherwise, will determine suitability, it will be a full consideration of a client’s circumstances.\nThis is great news for those who believe in the skill and ability of advisers to do a good job, and surely for consumers, who should be under no doubt who to turn to for advice.\nThe paper is unequivocal about this, stating: ‘We propose to require all\nadvice on the transfer and conversion of safeguarded bene ts to include a personal recommendation’.

Consequently, advisory  rms must make sure that any software used meets their advice needs’.\nAs we alluded to in last quarter’s article,\nthe new ‘Transfer Value Comparator’ demonstrates where a ‘notional annuity purchase is being used as a proxy to determine the value that might be gained or lost by giving up the safeguarded bene ts’.\nIn short hand, you no longer compare pot sizes, you need to look at the amount that you would have to invest to achieve ‘a comparable level of guaranteed income on the open market.’\n "," 45\n     Traditionally of course, cash ow modelling was a technique developed and employed by self-identi ed ‘ nancial planners’, who understood (and still do of course) that\na  nancial plan must be aligned with the aspirations of a client, and can be used as a tool to help clients reach their potential, beyond their  nancial circumstances.\nRory Percival has gone on record to say\nthat advising in the retirement area is ‘impossible without some kind of cash ow modelling’. The new world requires all advisers to connect with their inner planner for retirement advice. Due diligence may\nbe the greatest requirement for newcomers to cash ow modelling, but they should embrace the lesson that  nancial planning has taught, in that exploring various scenarios will help clients visualise their retirement journeys, connect emotionally with their plans and identify their objectives more effectively.\nSynaptic Analyser will allow you to apply the lessons of current research around investments relating to new insights into tax ef cient retirement planning, acknowledging the possible ravages of sequence risk, the science of safe withdrawal rates, and the wisdom of cashbuffers, multiple strategies and developing diverse sources of income.\nWhen designing the new Synaptic Retirement Income and drawdown analysis functionality, we were conscious of the tradition of  nancial planning and saw the opportunity to build a due diligence tool that also facilitated interaction with clients.\nAbout Synaptic Analyser:\nAll aspects of retirement income are easily modelled in the new tool– you can even\nset income as a single value using a slider. Synaptic Analyser can help calculate the impact of tax or in ation; help calculate projected values and maturity values as well as provide the best open market annuity income obtained from the Webline panel of annuity providers.\nThe panel below shows the dashboard of key calculations, including the ‘Maximum annuity income’ available.\nThe results indicated show illustrations\nfor actual drawdown products, helping to ful l due diligence requirements in the new world, linked as they are directly to the client’s actual plan.\nWhether you identify as a  nancial coach, or a traditional independent advice practitioner, Synaptic may be the best option for your business. Discounts are available to existing Synaptic users as well as newcomers, so please call our team on 0800 7834477 for more information, a demo or a trial.\n","                                                    The Suitability Suite\nRisk .

The MiFID\nII deadline in Jan 2018 says that all tools need to be ‘ t for purpose,’ and crucially, ‘with any limitations identi ed and actively mitigated through the suitability assessment process’.\nThe Synaptic questionnaire is one that Moody’s Analytics have aligned their\nrisk model to, created by specialists in psychometric testing, Dr Alistair Byrne and Professor David Blake. A2Risk is the company they formed which gives its name to the questionnaire today. You should know that you are in good company as Vanguard, Royal London and various others make this the most widely-used questionnaire in the UK,\nin aggregate.\nHere are the basics, paraphrased from Rory Percival’s summary:\n1. Riskpro le–thelevelofcomfortthat\na client feels for any investment. This doesn’t take into account a client’s ability to sustain investment losses. (Crucially the questionnaire also provides an audit trail for the important discussion on risk between client and adviser).\n2. Capacity for Loss – the level of risk that a client is ‘able’ to take. This requires the expertjudgementofanadviser.Thisisthe part of due diligence that is most often considered to be inadequate, according to Rory Percival.\n3. Knowledgeandexperience–theability for a  rm to build a ‘reasonable basis for\nbelieving’ that the client has the ‘necessary experience and knowledge to understand the risks involved in the transaction’.\nThe Synaptic proposition is built around the simulated outputs from Moody’s Analytics stochastic engine in the form of probability- based projections for investment outcomes. Our belief is that without ascribing probability to a full range of possible outcomes, an informed decision on risk is impossible.\nMoody’s Analytics probability-based models have been proven over many years in their ability to project an accurate range for loss and gain across various asset classes, taking into account the interaction of asset classes in a portfolio. Their key attribute is the ability to provide ‘risk graded fund ratings using risk metrics which are relevant to the distinct savings objectives of different groups of customers’:\nThe Synaptic risk ratings provide a handy summary of these key attributes by fund or portfolio and provide useful fact sheets to include as part of recommendations. The ‘min gain’ identi es the 5% worst outcomes from the mathematical simulation that the model produces, also known as the ‘Capacity for Loss’ quotient (as 5% is equivalent to the worst year in terms of returns expected over 20 years). You use this value to cover due diligence proof points 2. and 3. opposite. By quantifying the worst extent of losses expected within an investment strategy, a skilled adviser will be able to judge whether it is within a client’s\nrisk tolerances, enabling him to acquire the ‘informed consent’ he needs.\nFor more information on Synaptic Risk you can visit www.synaptic.co.uk.

Synaptic Software have requested asset allocation information from participating providers in a specific format aligned to the risk framework of the system. These asset classes are used by the model to determine the risk rating, a process that may result in a level of approximation though in most cases this will be insignificant. It is also possible that certain asset classes may not be represented exactly in the manner that providers would prefer.\nReasonable endeavours are made to provide accuracy and consistency, however neither participating providers nor Synaptic Software can be held responsible for any errors or omissions. No recommendation should be made solely on the basis of the Synaptic Risk Ratings, and additional research should be undertaken for any case.
