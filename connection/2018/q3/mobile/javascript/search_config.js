There was concern from the regulator at the time that clients may be ‘shoe- horned’ into investment vehicles that weren’t necessarily optimal on a client by client basis.\nBut by focussing on suitability, the gaze\nshifted away from the need to prove that each investment solution was a tailored suit, and the FSA (as they were then) con rmed that\nan independent adviser could have all their clients on a single platform. Central Investment Propositions, or CIPs, are built through client segmentation and allow  rms to streamline processes and standardise advice. Most providers/asset managers are seeking to align with  rms as part of their CIP.\nGoing back to those years where the FSA was developing its thinking on suitability and the use of platforms, celebrated technical expert and ambassador for all things Welsh, Mr Chris Thomas, encouraged us to approach research and due diligence in relation to ‘Investment Pathways’. Indeed, most of our customers have developed their research and due diligence around the concept of these pathways – whether full DFM/DFM MPS/Model Portfolios/ Bespoke Portfolios or Multi-asset funds.\nOur development road map is being  nalised as we consider our role in the coming years, supporting the independent advice  rms of the future. We are clear that the focus of our development will be around better supporting advisers accessing their CIPs for research and due diligence purposes. Synaptic Research provides a unique resource in the industry - we constantly collect and verify much of the data that populates our tools. As a result, the asset allocations that produce our ratings are reliable, the pricing shapes that are accessed within our Analyser and Comparator tools are precise, and our whole-of-market product data is similarly accurate.\nWe have also been introduced to what\nwe think is an extraordinary proposition, Munnypot (see p6). We are gaining inspiration and help from them to establish a modern, digital foundation to our own proposition.We like the fact that the principals are ex-heads\nof IFA businesses. We’d be happy to introduce any of our customers, who may be considering automated advice as an extension of their own proposition, to Munnypot.\nEric Armstrong\nEditor\n   Contact Details\nSynaptic Software Limited\nFusion 1, Parkway, Solent Business Park Whiteley, Hampshire PO15 7AA\nSales: 0800 783 4477\nTo sign up for Connection magazine visit\nwww.synaptic.co.uk\nAll editorial or advertising enquiries should be directed to:\nEric Armstrong\neric.armstrong@synaptic.co.uk 01489 882994\nSarah Miller\nmarketing@synaptic.co.uk 0800 783 4477\nIf you no longer wish to receive a copy of this publication, please email marketing@synaptic.co.uk\nThe Connection magazine is published by Synaptic Software Limited.

There is no escaping the fact that technology has created less costly ways to deliver advice with a broader reach.\nMany of the foundational tools of  nancial planning, such as rebalancing and portfolio construction, can now be done by algorithms in a more ef cient, scalable manner. Some have gone so far as to predict so-called “robo-advice” propositions will spell the end of human  nancial advisers.\nWe could choose to buy into the doom-and- gloom, seeing technology as a threat and automation taking away jobs. However, there is another choice. We can instead choose to see technology as an opportunity, embracing the automation it brings. Why risk becoming Blockbuster if you can choose to be Net ix? Far from being automated away, at Vanguard we believe the job of an adviser is very much here to stay. However, the day-to-day tasks an adviser performs are likely to change.\nThis has implications for the future of the traditional advice model.\nVanguard has conducted extensive research into the advice market in the US, leading to a number of publications in 2017 and 2018,\nincluding The Evolution of Adviser’s Alpha: From Portfolios to People which is currently available in the UK. We have now leveraged this experience to conduct a major study, the Vanguard UK Adviser-Client Survey. We have directly interviewed 300 practising advisers and wealth managers, and 1,000 advised clients, focusing on what advice in the future will look like in the UK.\nOur starting point is to step back and look at the future of jobs in general. Our research into the impact of technology on jobs suggests the tasks most likely to be automated away are those that are basic and repetitive in nature1. On the other hand, “advanced” tasks - those that rely on things like creativity, strategising, and maintaining relationships – are uniquely human and tend to be much more resilient to automation.\nWhile we cannot predict what technology will look like in the future, if other industries are any guide we can feel con dent that the way advisers can add value will change. Routine\ntasks will likely be automated away, leaving only those tasks that can be considered uniquely human.\nOne example of a uniquely human task advisers perform is behavioural coaching. While often overlooked, there is signi cant value in providing a client with peace of mind.\nActing as a behavioural coach, advisers can prevent clients taking on excessive risk, chasing returns and generally making decisions that harm their chances of investment success.\nHowever, it will be hard to prevent a client from selling out in the heat of a  nancial crisis if it is the  rst time you are having that conversation. Behavioural coaching is only effective if clients are prepared in advance for the challenges that may come their way and, as the responses of our US Advised Investor Insights survey show, have trust in the relationship.\n1See The Evolution of Adviser’s Alpha: From Portfolios to People for a more in depth examination of this topic. www.vanguard.co.uk/adviser/adv/ articles/research-commentary/topical-insights/evolution-vanguard-advisors-alpha.jsp\]\n "," 5\n  Many of the foundational tools of  nancial planning, such as rebalancing and portfolio construction, can now done by algorithms in a more ef cient, scalable manner.\n  Source: Vanguard\nNot all advice can be automated\nSo, what determines trust? Interestingly, more than half of survey respondents placed the most weight on drivers of trust that are emotional in nature. Clients selected “being the client’s advocate” and “acting in the client’s best interest” as the most important drivers. While the functional and ethical aspects (in short, what advisers do and how they do it) are still essential, it was surprising to  nd that emotions play a greater role than both of those combined.\nUnfortunately there is no shortcut to building trust. Trust is built over time. Indeed, our research found higher levels of trust were associated with longer relationships, while\na perceived lack of attention and time was the main motivation for switching advisers. Our US survey suggests clients want what automation cannot provide – a relationship.\nRede ning their value proposition to one of holistic wealth management, advisers will be best placed to compete with the challenges\nautomation may bring. For US investors, in\na world where time is of increasingly short supply,  nding ways to spend more time with clients will be paramount for success.\nWe are interested to see if this translates across the pond. What do UK investors value in an adviser-client relationship? Trust means different things to different people – will it look different for UK investors compared to their US counterparts? Do they place the same value on the emotional aspects? This summer we have set out to try and answer these questions and more, conducting a survey focused on UK advisers and advised- investors.\nPreliminary  ndings from the advisers and investors surveyed so far here in the UK appear to suggest similarities. As one client put it, “I want a close relationship, but I don’t want my IFA to be a friend... they need to\nbe a trusted professional, like a GP”. While the ideal relationship may not be radically different to what is currently on offer, initial\nresponses indicate clients are looking for more empathy and proactivity in their partnerships. However, this will be easier said than done. As one adviser we interviewed said, “There is no manual for how to ask life questions...”.\nNor is there any manual for succeeding in a world of increasing automation. We hope, however, that the  ndings of our survey can at least help point advisers in the right direction. We’ll be sharing our  ndings at our Adviser Symposiums this autumn\n(see www.vanguard.co.uk/advisers). We hope you can join us.\nInvestment risk Information\nThe value of investments, and the income from them, may fall or rise and investors may get back less than they invested.

Advisers have a history of building strong, long-term customer relationships, building up trust over time and becoming essential to the lives of high net worth\nclients.\nBut the  nancial advice market is changing\n• Cost of advice is growing – The cost of offering traditional advice is growing due to regulatory requirements (GDPR, MiFiD II, the IDD) and this trend is set to continue.\n• It’s not just millennials – Savers with larger investments are actually the most willing to adopt automated advice for at least part of their investment portfolio (see Figure 2).\n• £35bn AUM will be robo-advised in the UK alone by 2022* – A new wave of disruptive advisers is  owing into this sector.\n1\n1\nTraditional IFAs need to compete in this space in order to survive.\nThese market dynamics create a challenging environment for the adviser community. However, they also present a signi cant opportunity.\n• Asset owners of the future expect a digital experience – Future generations of high net worth individuals expect digital alternatives to traditional models and are willing to pay for automated advice (see Figure 1). Unless advisers  nd a way to service these customers, in our view they will lose out to digital disruptors. This lack of certainty in the future is impacting the value of IFA businesses today.\n3\n2\n2\n  0%\nFigure 1.\nWillingness to invest more than £10,000 using\n5a%utomated  nancial advice by wealth level 0%\n28%\n5%\n0%\n5%\n0%\n13%\n£1,000 or more\n15%\n£5,000 or more\n19%\n£30,000 or more\n Source: YouGov 23-24 January 2017, Deloitte analysis in 2017 Deloitte report: \"The next frontier: The future of automated financial advice in the UK\".

Build a low-cost advice offering in-house\nBut creating an in-house automated product from scratch requires signi cant capital, technology and time, inevitably detracting valuable resources away from core business.\n2. Direct clients to a self-service platform\nAdvisers spend years learning how to provide appropriate  nancial advice. We would never expect someone to diagnose their own health, so why do we expect people to manage their own wealth? Moreover, once a customer is entrenched in self-service management of their assets, it is extremely dif cult to bring them back to the traditional advice model.\n3.

Sorry. It’s just that yours truly is writing this article on his last day at work, three days before getting married. As a result of the FCA paper landing in the same week, my head is a cold soup of the two. Hydrangea colours mixed with model portfolio risk bandings. Catering quantities coupled with platform switching issues. It’s a dizzying mix.\nIt’s funny though, despite me writing this in the present tense, by the time you read this the wedding will be over, and everyone and his dog will have had their say on the platform study. Writing something for publication is a curious form of time travel in that respect.\nIn many ways, for reasons I’ll get onto in a moment, I wish the FCA had the same level of awareness when compiling its latest tome. In mid-July last year, chances are if you work in platforms that you were having a good read of the FCA’s Investment Platforms Market Study Terms of Reference paper.\nFast forward 12 months (Great Scott!)\nand here we go again. This time, it’s the Interim Report, together with eight annex documents totalling a sturdy 400 pages of output if you can’t resist totalling these kind of things up. Yet, despite the weight of work\nthat’s gone into it, I’m left frustrated by several aspects.\nWhat was the question again?\nLast year’s terms of reference posed two headline questions covering the topics to\nbe explored. Firstly, “How do platforms\nand similar  rms compete on the price and quality of the services and products they offer and the products over which they have in uence?” And secondly, “Do platform and similar  rms’ investment solutions offer investors value for money?”. Sadly, neither of these questions comes close to being answered in the interim report.\nCan everyone please board via platform one?\nOne of the real positives of this exercise is the depth of customer research that\naccompanied the project. The research, led by NMG, surveyed approximately 3,000 end-customers (you know, those awkward people who fund our industry) on their views of platform usage, and serves as a pertinent reminder of some of the real issues facing customers.\nThis consumer research highlights just how (understandably) different the advised and non-advised segments are. Which begs the question as to why the FCA has lumped two completely different markets together in one paper?\nFor example, asking advised clients their main reasons for using an online investment platform alongside non-advised clients is jarring when surely Les Dennis’ top answer is “Because my adviser told me to”. We feel that a more structured, differentiated approach\n  "," 9\n            This consumer research highlights just how (understandably) different the advised and non-advised segments are. Which begs the question as to why the FCA has lumped two completely different markets together in one paper?\nto the two markets for the next wave of the project would be of real bene t.\nSecondly, there is no real effort to offer an issues-based segmentation of the individual platforms within the market. You’re either ‘a platform’ or you’re not. When, as I’ve covered in previous articles, these beasts are far from the same. The issues facing an adviser who ‘owns’ their tech proposition off-platform and uses, say, a Transact or a Nucleus or an Ascentric are fundamentally different to the business models of, say, Intrinsic users on Old Mutual Wealth. Which leads me onto...\nWhere is the vertically integrated market? Behind the sofa?\nWhen your initial terms of reference have such a clear focus on value for money and the in uence of price and quality on client propositions, then to pay little more than lip service to vertically integrated propositions (where there have been signi cant questions raised over the value for money of some of the solutions) feels very, very odd to us.\nStop moaning about things that aren’t there\nIndeed. What we DO have is a study that has concluded that we have  ve groups of consumers for whom the FCA reckons competition between platforms is not working well:\n1. Those who would bene t from switching but can  nd it dif cult.\nThe ease with which both advised and non- advised clients can move between platforms touches on lots of important subjects, such as exit fees, share classes and transfer times. Again, we feel the dichotomy of the advised versus D2C markets is a little lost here but progress on transfer times can only be a good thing for the reputation of the industry.\n2. Thosewhoarepricesensitivebutcan  nd shopping around dif cult.\nThis one is aimed at the direct space, and whilst we would applaud moves to make it easier to shop around, in a world where many direct consumers either don’t think they pay platform charges or don’t know, perhaps more work is needed on clarity of charges disclosure  rst.\n3. Thosewhousemodelportfolios.The risks and expected returns of model portfolios with similar risk labels are unclear and can lead to confusion about how much risk they are facing.\nThat consumers, mainly using D2C platforms, using these model portfolios and suggested multi-asset funds may have the wrong idea about the risk/return levels they face also feels like an area in need of improved disclosure and clarity of information, especially when investment performance is a far bigger driver of customer outcomes than saving a few percentage points on a platform charge.\n4. Those who have large cash balances on direct platforms. They may not know they are missing out on investment returns and/or that they are paying charges.\nWe have mentioned this a number of times\n– the combination of low interest rates and platform charges means that if you are using a platform to “invest” in cash, you are probably getting net negative returns as a result.\n5. Thosewhonolongerhaveanadviser and are still on an advised platform but may face higher charges and lower levels of service (referred to as ‘orphan clients’).\nPlatforms have always had a TCF obligation here, but it looks like the bar may be raised. The suggested requirement for platforms to check that clients are receiving an advised service is also one to watch.\nSo, there we have it. De nitely a mixed bag and we await the  nal recommendations with bated breath. Until then, it’s back to the last- minute wedding prep. I might weave some platform analogies into the speech. I reckon that’s a winner, don’t you?

It has served its clients through the tumults of war and profound social, industrial and technological change. Five years ago Cazenove Capital came together with another great family business, Schroders - ushering in a new chapter of growth, where even more skill and resource could be harnessed for the bene t of its clients. Today Cazenove Capital is one of Britain’s biggest wealth managers, trusted by thousands of individuals and charities to safeguard and grow their assets.\nYour client comes  rst\nCazenove Capital has been working with  nancial advisers for more than 15 years.\nWe offer broad support including regular meetings with a dedicated portfolio manager, comprehensive reporting services and digital valuation tools, giving both you and your client instant access to online valuations. But whether you are a small practice or national  rm, we are respectful of your relationship with your client: how you choose to work with\nus will be led by you. We will support your brand.\nPortfolios are tailored according to your clients’ risk pro le and goals. They can\nalso be tailored to re ect individual clients’ environmental and social values. Once an asset allocation strategy has been agreed,\nwe will ensure it adapts appropriately as your clients’ circumstances change and in line with your advice.\nInvestment process\nCazenove Capital aims to deliver real growth with an eye to costs and tax ef ciency.\nOur established central investment approach rests on a careful reading of the business cycle and an understanding of the impact this has on different asset classes. Risk is then controlled through a highly diversi ed allocation.\nThe chart (right) reveals our view on where major world markets are currently positioned in the cycle.\nAs a result of this view we are today tilted toward cash and alternative investments (including absolute return funds and structured products) and are neutral overall on equities. Within our equities allocation, we favour Japanese and emerging markets.\n  "," 11\n  Cazenove Capital traces its origins back to the early years of the 19th century. It has served its clients through the tumults of war and profound social, industrial and technological change.\nWe have a neutral position on European and US equities – and we are currently slightly negative on UK equities, given the fall-off in growth and uncertainties arising from Brexit. A summary of our investment team’s views across asset classes and currencies is updated and published regularly.\nappropriate potential holdings, wherever these are managed.\nWhere appropriate, we make signi cant\nuse of alternative investments, such as absolute return funds and structured products, to which your clients might not otherwise have access. Cazenove Capital believes that companies have the ability to enhance their long-term performance through an understanding of the environmental,\nsocial and governance issues affecting their business. An awareness of these issues enables companies to potentially mitigate risks as\nwell as realise opportunities. Companies that combine good governance and corporate responsibility will tend to deliver long-term shareholder value over time.\nOur other services\nCazenove Capital offers banking services including deposit and current accounts\nfor existing clients. In addition, we offer short-term loans secured against clients’ portfolios or properties. These are individually underwritten and can offer advisers and\ntheir clients a valuable planning opportunity - especially where a clients’ age or income pro le makes them ineligible for mainstream mortgage products.\nOur inheritance tax (IHT) portfolio service offers a further planning opportunity for clients seeking to mitigate death duties. The portfolio comprises investments in companies which qualify for Business Property Relief.\nUnder current rules, these investments become exempt from inheritance tax after they have been held for two years. By contrast, gifts or transfers are not wholly exempt from IHT until seven years have passed. With our IHT Portfolio Service, clients continue to control and have access to their investments which, if held within an ISA, are not subject to other forms of tax.\nUnusually within the wealth management industry we welcome clients who are\nUS citizens or who have links to the US. Increasingly complex tax reporting and other regulatory requirements have made this group dif cult to serve. Our specialist Americas Team, however, is fully able and committed to meeting their needs. The team is among the small number of UK-based operations to be registered by the US regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nFor more information about Cazenove Capital’s Discretionary Fund Management Service, contact Simon Cooper at simon.cooper@cazenovecapital.com or on 020 7658 1343.\nDisclaimer: This article is issued by Cazenove Capital, which is part of the Schroders Group and is a trading name of Schroder\n& Co.

Examples include High Frequency traders,\nETFs, trackers, algorithmic trading strategies, rules-based quant, and so on. In other words, only 10% of trading volumes actually originate from discretionary trades by investors. But why does this obsession with ETFs matter?\nWell, performance for one hasn’t been as strong as you may imagine, particularly\nwhen you compare Traditional Index Funds (TIFs) with ETFs. The founder of Vanguard, Jack Bogle, recently shared his analysis of dollar-weighted investor returns with the investment magazine Barron’s3. The research shows that from 2005 to 2017, the average investor return from TIFs was 8.4%, whereas for ETFs, it was 5.5%. If ETF performance is so much worse than TIFs then one might ask – “what is the point?”\nVolatility exacerbated\nThe marginal buyer or seller drives the price of a good and, in this case, a share price or index level. As a consequence, one of the fundamental issues for investors is that passive investing is indiscriminate; there is\nno price discovery mechanism relating to\nthe underlying equity. Participants not driven by the analysis of fundamental factors are therefore responsible for share price levels. The advent of products such as Smart Beta ETFs that allow investors to invest in a speci c sector or style means that when markets are going up, money  ows freely into crowded assets that are trading at expensive multiples. Then when markets subsequently correct, investors (often retail) withdraw their money and sell at the bottom, creating a cascade effect. The effect of this ever-growing wall of passive money could mean that future bubbles could be bigger, and troughs could be deeper, at least temporarily.\nSince 2008, yield compression in conventional low risk income assets such as Gilts, Treasuries and Cash has forced investors into higher\nrisk or income producing strategies such\nas selling Chicago Board Option Exchange (CBOE) Volatility Index (VIX) options or buying inverse VIX ETFs. Selling VIX options to generate income or yield has been compared to picking up stones in front of a steam train. We only need to look at the VIX blow up from February this year where many investors lost the total value of their short volatility position in a matter of hours. This kind of occurrence is a cautionary tale of the risks of investing in complex levered products.\nThe “liquidity lobster trap”\nAnother issue that we are wary of is the liquidity mismatch that could impact investors in the event of a market stress event. Firstly, ETFs are vehicles that are priced and trade continuously, yet invest in assets that often cannot provide daily liquidity. Investing in assets with poor liquidity can\nbe like a “lobster trap”; very easy to get into\n "," 13\n  We expect to see an increase in volatility in markets and as such, we believe that it is prudent to invest in active managers and at the very least, hold assets that you understand and have ample liquidity.\nbut impossible to get out when you need to escape. History has shown us that liquidity, in the  xed income space in particular, can dry up (as witnessed during the Global Financial Crisis), and most commonly for sectors with the lowest levels of liquidity such as emerging market debt and High Yield.\nAnother issue that investors may encounter is that investors holding synthetic ETFs (ETFs that rely on derivatives such as swaps to execute its investment strategy instead of physically owning the stock) may  nd that the return pro le of their ETF is somewhat different to the underlying index, due to either replication or composition or other market factors. Daily rebalancing and compounding on a leveraged ETF could result in a negative return, despite the fact that the underlying index is up over the investment horizon. This happened in 2008 for many investors who were short the market.\nFinally, investors in synthetic ETFs expose themselves to the risk that one of the derivative counterparties defaults. Synthetic ETFs are popular because they frequently have a lower tracking error and are sometimes cheaper than physically replicated ETFs. However, it is not uncommon for individuals to underestimate, or even misunderstand,\nthis counterparty and collateralisation risk, ultimately resulting in the potential loss of all the initial investment.\nIt’s not hard to understand why ETFs and passive products have been so popular since 2009, particularly as markets have continued\nto push higher through a combination of share buybacks, multiple expansion and for the large part, low volatility. However, betting on a repeat of the last nine years is a bet that we are unwilling to make, particularly\nas central banks begin to batten down the hatches and embark on part two of the most extraordinary money experiment in history (transitioning from Quantitative Easing to Quantitative Tightening). The taper tantrum of 2013 demonstrated the dif cult task that Central Banks have in taking liquidity out of the system.\nLooking forward, we expect to see an increase in volatility in markets and as such, we believe that it is prudent to invest in active managers and at the very least, hold assets that you understand and have ample liquidity.\nConsequently, in the LGT Vestra MPS portfolios, we only hold funds that we have researched, and we try to avoid investments that may encounter liquidity issues. It is for this reason that we sold our exposure to open-ended property vehicles in 2016 prior to the Brexit referendum and it is also why we are cognisant of the risks posed by holding funds that have an elevated percentage of unlisted assets. Holding that jazzy 3X Levered Smart Beta ETF might be popular with clients but when the market drops 20% it may not look quite so impressive after all.\nFor more information, please visit lgtvestra.com\nImportant information\nLGT Vestra LLP is authorised and regulated\nby the Financial Conduct Authority.

MiFID II builds on the original Directive, with the aim of further strengthening investor protection, and carries a heightened focus on the key elements of suitability and transparency.\nWhilst these are principles we stand behind, transitioning the theory into practice has proved to be challenging for many advisers. With this in mind, how can you ensure\nthat the MiFID II regulatory storm acts as the wind beneath your wings, rather than blowing your house down? In this article, I will explore the potential investment solutions which can help you to overcome the challenges of MiFID II, and provide an enhanced service to your clients.\nThe starting line\nWhether you outsource your investment strategies to a discretionary fund manager, or simply choose to implement your investment strategy through an advisory capacity, the MiFID II Directive requires that you demonstrate client suitability and risk alignment throughout your centralised investment process (CIP). Implementing a de ned process for selecting investment\nstrategies allows you to demonstrate clear parameters that you can, in turn, apply to your segmented clients. At the end of the day, your selected investment strategy must match your client’s appetite to risk and ability to bear loss.\nSo how do you select the appropriate investment solution to meet your needs\nand, most importantly, the needs of your clients, and how do you implement and monitor your investment solutions in the most ef cient way? In addition, how do you monitor the performance of your investment strategies against your expectations, ensuring your strategy always aligns with your risk pro ling tool?\nFor an independent business model you will need to start with a review of the relevant market. Enhanced suitability questions can be used to  lter out investment options that are not suitable for your clients. You\nwill need to conduct a robust assessment\nof your client’s attitude to risk, tolerance for loss, and ability to bear losses. Tools such as Centra (the end-to-end  nancial planning system designed by the SimplyBiz Group and powered by Defaqto) allow you to select investment strategies that are appropriate for your client, by aligning investment solutions with your client’s needs.\nThe MiFID II Directive requires that you document and formalise your centralised investment process. You will need to outline the processes that allow you to conduct research and planning, determine your client’s risk pro le, set recommendations and  nally compile a suitability report (which must be issued prior to the recommended product transaction being concluded). The Centra system allows you to deliver on all these process requirements and seamlessly links all elements of your CIP, whilst still\n "," 15\n  Implementing a de ned process for selecting investment strategies allows you to demonstrate clear parameters that you can, in\nturn, apply to your segmented clients. At the end of the day, your selected investment strategy must match your client’s appetite to risk and ability to bear loss.\nallowing you to retain your independence by using a whole of market independent tool.\nWith these issues in mind, which investment strategies should you consider?\n1. Risk versus return: At the outset, you will need to agree your client’s attitude to risk. You will also need to manage your client’s performance expectations in relation\nto their risk tolerance. In order to meet your client’s expectations, make use of an investment solution that will absolutely align to your risk pro ling tool.\n2. Adherence to strategic asset allocation and volatility parameters: Seek out investment solutions that adhere to the strategic asset allocation and volatility parameters of your risk pro ling tool.\nFind an investment solution you can\nbe certain will not deviate from these parameters, and is designed to deliver to your expected risk and return consistently.\n3. Fixed strategy conditions: Look for investment solutions that give you the power to set the conditions for your clients. Whether you choose an active or a multi-index strategy, select an investment solution which gives you the mandate to populate that strategic asset allocation that will, in turn, align to your risk pro ling tool.\n4. Clear parameters that match your target market: Utilise investment strategies that have a proven track record of performance in line with your risk\nand return expectations, fall within your strategic asset allocation and volatility parameters, and meet your expectations.\n5. Reporting: Choose investment strategies that provide you with clear and transparent reporting and that allow you to demonstrate your client’s fees in relation to performance in a transparent manner.\nAt Verbatim Asset Management, we understand the many challenges advisers face in the management and construction of investment portfolios.

Selecting and managing investments requires specialised knowledge and time to maintain suitable client portfolios.\nWe have now combined our experience of working with advisers with our knowledge of funds and created ‘our best ideas’.\nThe RSMR Discretionary Portfolio Service\n- Rfolios - has been created to deliver improved investor outcomes, simplify the advice process and enhance the overall client experience. With the ability to match existing or planned advice models, choice and  exibility are key for the investor and adviser alike.\nOur portfolios rise incrementally in risk and by making use of the asset allocations we provide for you, together with back-tested risk and performance data, you can map each portfolio to whichever risk pro ling process you are using.\nOffering a choice of growth, income & SRI themed portfolios with active and passive strategies, all the portfolios are backed with RSMR’s unrivalled track record.\nWorking alongside advisers\nWe work with you and for the last 14 years our personal and tailored approach has set us apart from the crowd. Working in partnership with you, we reduce any concerns and deliver improvements that bene t the end investor (your client) and your business, providing:\n• More time for you to focus on growing your business and managing existing client relationships – adding to the bottom line\n• Reduced administrative costs by outsourcing responsibility for investment management decisions delivering an enhanced client service\n• Improved client proposition through access to a range of risk graded discretionary model portfolios – removing the risk of portfolio drift\n• Reduced regulatory risks with the RSMR research team in support of your business.\nOur rigorous research process\nAll of our portfolios are constructed using the same rigorous research processes that support our fund ratings and all the funds in the portfolios will be selected from our rated fund list. The process for putting together the portfolios can be summarised as follows:\n  "," 17\n  Our portfolios rise incrementally in risk and by making use of the asset allocations we provide for you, together with back-tested risk and performance data, you can map each portfolio to whichever risk pro ling process you are using.\nOur approach\nWe know that you may already have a risk pro ling and advice process in place and our portfolios have been set up to  t into your existing processes, allowing you to focus on the areas where you add most value, and using us to complement your skills in the others.\nResearch indicates that the elements where clients believe advisers add most value are fact  nding, identifying client needs and goals, assessing the clients’ appetite for\nrisk and the ongoing service and support (coloured blue on the diagram above).\nThe other parts of the advice process (coloured green) take time and expertise with many advisers taking the decision to use specialist resources to help, freeing time for them to focus their skills on the discussion with the client and generating fee income.\nAsset allocation\nThe asset allocation has been put together with a number of aims in mind. Firstly, we’ve developed a variety of portfolio options to meet the varied needs of your clients.\nSecondly, we recognise that most advisers encourage their clients to take a long term view and to avoid a reaction to each and every change in market direction. We’ve therefore focused on taking a strategic approach with each portfolio, with our eye  rmly on the 3-5 year time horizon. We will have shorter term tactical views, but these\nwill be expressed through the funds that we choose. In our experience, this approach provides the most suitable investment process for the majority of clients and avoids unnecessarily high portfolio turnover.\nThirdly, we have assumed that outside the lower end of the risk scale, investors would be 100% invested in cash, and outside the higher end they would be 100% invested in higher risk and less diversi ed investment strategies.\nPerformance reporting and support\nFund switches and portfolio rebalancing will take place automatically and you will also have the opportunity to utilise your platform of choice. We will also formally review and report on the portfolios on a quarterly basis.\nWe will look not just at the underlying funds, but also at the portfolios as a whole, and how they have performed (both in terms of return and risk) in comparison to the benchmark.\nDetailed portfolio factsheets are available to support the portfolios, plus our reporting and quarterly newsletters for investors.\nContact us for more details on 01535 656 555 or enquiries@rsmgroup.co.uk\nImportant Notice\nThis is intended for investment professionals and should not\nbe relied upon by private investors or any other persons.

The simple part is straightforward. One waits for a share price to fall, carries out some due diligence to check for any hidden nasties, checks the stock is cheap on some sensible assumptions and then buys the share. And if everything goes to plan, the shares, as they recover, will attract the attention of other investors and provide the investor with a handsome pro t.\nThe ‘not easy’ part is where the sweating begins. A stock only tends to fall if investors have some concerns about a company’s future.There\nmay be issues over a company’s indebtedness, accounting, industry exposure or some purely idiosyncratic issue and virtually all of the time\nit is perfectly rational to hold these concerns. And, in many cases, history tells us it is correct to have such concerns as worst-case scenarios can often play out (of which a recent example is Carillion).\nBut a more dispassionate assessment of history tells us that on the whole these worst-case scenarios are a fairly rare species. They just tend to stick more in investors’ minds than those stocks which do recover.\nWhat can often be worse than the embarrassment of holding one stock that\ndoes very badly is holding a portfolio of stocks which, in general, are doing reasonably badly. This typically happens in markets which are in uenced by a signi cant and prolonged theme – such as the technology, media and telecoms bubble in the late 90s and the mining bubble\nin the mid-noughties. At such times equity markets can become bifurcated with a group of stocks heavily in favour and the rest unloved.\nWe have been in one of these times over recent years. The belief that in ation will remain low for an extended period of time has seen interest rates fall to extraordinarily low levels, and this has created a number of market-wide effects that have worked against us. By reducing the discount rates that are applied to equity earnings, lower interest rates have disproportionately favoured more highly rated quality/growth stocks which have a greater proportion of their value further out in the future.\nI’ve been on the wrong side of things and am seated  rmly on the naughty step. I’ve been sitting there for so long now, that I’m starting to leave an impression.\nSo, what to do?\nThere are three options. Option one is to simply capitulate – admit that the world has changed, that the old rules do not work and to embrace the dark side. Option two is to sit tight, accept one’s portfolio is signi cantly different from\nthe market and trust that eventually themes (however strong the story) will reverse. Option three is to break the  rst law of digging holes made famous by Dennis Healey, the Labour politician, who opined that, “if you  nd yourself in a hole, stop digging”. If the bifurcated market throws up increasingly attractive opportunities it is surely right to keep buying?\n What can often\nbe worse than the embarrassment of holding one stock that does very badly is holding a portfolio of stocks which, in general, are doing reasonably badly.\n "," 19\n  By reducing the discount rates that are applied to equity earnings, lower interest rates have disproportionately favoured more highly rated quality/growth stocks which have a greater proportion of their value further out in the future.\nAt this point, the career risk that Jeremy Grantham, founder of GMO, has often talked about becomes relevant. It stops being how long the fund manager can take the pain of underperformance and morphs into a discussion on how long the client is willing to take the pain of underperformance.\nFor a contrarian investor (and we are talking about a portfolio of stocks here rather than\nan individual stock) the typical response\nis somewhere between options 2 and 3. Continue to analyse the opportunity set and\nas it becomes ever more attractive to do so, skew the portfolio more towards the cheapest stocks. However, it is probably best not to come over as too pig-headed, bloody-minded or unprepared to investigate alternative views.‘The market is obviously wrong’ rarely wins plaudits with clients on the receiving end of one’s underperformance.\nLooking in the tea leaves\nThe psychologist will tell you at these times that to remain rational, one should actively search for those whose views oppose your own. Continually seeking solace from like-minded individuals can quickly encourage ‘con rmation bias’ – the belief that something must be right because someone else agrees with you. Clearly it is healthy to search for contrasting views, but at such times the opposition have the upper hand – they are supported by a good narrative to which a trending share price brings further validation. The contrarian, on the other hand, appears to have just conjecture – ‘what if the story reverses even though there is no sign of\nit in the tea leaves’, or history – ‘something typically turns up; the market’s just not always smart enough to see it’.\nIt’s not that the psychologists are wrong – it’s more that when markets or stocks are at extreme levels, there is probably not a great deal of rationality on either side. Someone who sold a stock a lot higher is busy patting themselves on the back and telling their war story rather than considering whether the price has gone too far or the facts have changed. Whereas someone who purchased a stock on the way down only to lose a reasonable amount of money is busy licking their wounds, reluctant to add to a position and worried that the market knows something they don’t. In these cases it is often good to return to analysis conducted in quieter, more rational times. The popular view may be well made, but at a lower price and valuation, what odds are being received for taking the contra view?\nUnderperformance is never nice, but for investors with high conviction portfolios and/or distinct investment styles it is unfortunately an almost inevitable price to pay for subsequently experiencing the good times.\nwww.investecassetmanagement.com\nImportant information\nThis communication is for institutional investors and  nancial advisors only.

It’s been the unrestrained growth of the gig economy that has loosened up the labour market over the last decade enabling\nemployers to keep their wage bills under tight control. These days, there’s no end of jobs that can be done by employees on so-called ‘zero-hour’ contracts (which don’t commit the employer to offering stable hours or\nbene ts) and there are already well over a million Britons who currently work via online platforms such as Uber, Deliveroo and others1.\nTaking the gig\nMore tellingly, there are now about 50% more self-employed people in the UK than there were at the start of the century with over a million Britons reportedly taking the plunge in the 10 years since the  nancial crisis.

It’s been the unrestrained growth of the gig economy that has loosened up the labour market over the last decade enabling employers to keep their wage bills under tight control.\nUS and the UK, wage increases have been stalled for the better part of a decade. In fact, US wages actually peaked back in 2015 with recent US average hourly earnings data (the so-called ‘non-farm payrolls’) failing to hit expectations.\nMeanwhile, there’s increasing evidence to show that employers in the states are looking more closely at the non-salaried part of\nthe package they offer such as help with accommodation or reduced working hours. Others are resorting to recruiting students or banks of distance workers to address key skills shortages that are emerging in the US.\nThe picture is little different over here. Skill shortages are emerging as we head ever closer to full employment – especially in those areas where the differential between average salaries and average property prices is greatest. The situation is such that the Bank of England recently advocated the need for more migrant workers to help address the problem.\nThanks to the gig economy, a growing proportion of the UK workforce is unable\nto work as many hours as they might like, or for the salary they think they deserve, but are structurally incapable of negotiating improved wages. This helps to explain today’s ‘wageless’ recovery.\nThe gig is up\nThe gig economy then, when coupled with the continued rise of new technologies such as robotics and arti cial intelligence, has helped to keep in ation at bay – despite all the growth indicators that suggest it should be higher at this point in the cycle.\nThe quant model that we use to forecast\ncore CPI is among those that probably needs to be recalibrated to take account of factors such as the gig economy and the new wave of automation (referred to as ‘industry 4.0’) that’s currently revolutionising manufacturing. Like many models of its type, it looks at the level of sterling and the cost of commodities as key drivers of in ation. But sterling remains weak, which historically has meant that we end up ‘importing’ a degree of in ation, while commodity prices – most notably oil – have begun to tick up once more.\nLeft to its own devices, this model would suggest that core in ation (not even the full rate of in ation) could well hit 3% before it fades back. The fact that we don’t expect core CPI to go anywhere near this level in the coming months shows just how much impact the gig economy is having on labour markets and in ation.\nTo  nd out more about our solutions, speak to one of our Investment Directors on\n0207 167 3700, email enquiries@quilterinvestors.com or visit www.quilterinvestors.com\nImportant information\nPast performance is not a guide to future performance and may not be repeated.\nThe value of investments and the income from them may go down as well as up\nand investors may not get back any of the amount originally invested.

A recent escalation in rhetoric by US President Trump and action on tariffs have raised investor concerns over the global economic outlook. But are these fears justi ed and at what stage should we really be worried?\nIf we look at the global economic impact of the US fully implementing its threatened tariffs on Chinese imports, then our economic modelling suggests that the global impact is likely to be limited and manageable. We must keep in mind that despite the tariffs being bilateral, other economies could be impacted, for example Japan, Taiwan and South Korea, re ecting their role in China’s supply chain. Overall though, it is a deterioration that the global\neconomy should be able to weather, particularly given that most large economies are currently growing at above-trend levels.\nGiven this growth backdrop and current valuations, we believe that maintaining a pro-risk stance in our multi asset portfolios makes sense as long as the dispute remains largely bilateral (between the US and China) and does not extend beyond tariffs on USD450 billon of US imports from China.\nNonetheless, we remain mindful of the possible impact on sentiment and cross-asset correlations.\nHowever, our view could be challenged if the US decides to push ahead with its threat to impose blanket 20% auto tariffs. This is a more worrying prospect as more economies would be affected. That said, the situation may not signi cantly escalate if the US economy starts to show any signs of being adversely affected by recent measures.\nIn the longer term, there is scope for the global economy to counter a potentially increasingly isolationist US economy with its own push for deeper integration. Indeed, the vast majority of economies – including China – remain tied to the rules-based multilateral trading system. Recent progress with the Trans-Paci c Partnership (TPP)\nand the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) in Asia, as well as\n We believe that maintaining a pro-risk stance in our multi asset portfolios makes sense as long as the dispute remains largely bilateral (between the US and China) and does not extend beyond tariffs on USD450 billon of US imports from China.\n "," 23\n  If we look at the global economic impact of the US fully implementing its threatened tariffs on Chinese imports, then our economic modelling suggests that the global impact is likely to be limited and manageable.\nthe ongoing Belt and Road Initiative, are examples of deeper ties in a region that accounts for an ever-larger share of world GDP and trade  ows.\nA pro-risk investment stance\nNotwithstanding the recent investor nervousness over the trade tensions, the global economic picture remains good. Economic growth is robust, albeit more differentiated across economies this year than last. Growth has slowed in Europe and Japan, and in ation pressures have begun to build\nin the US, prompting a rise in bond yields,\nbut the corporate sector is in good shape, globally, and the risk of recession remains low. Given current valuations, we still believe that equities represent the best way to participate in underlying economic growth. We therefore maintain our moderately pro-risk positions\nin multi-asset portfolios, with a preference for global equities and emerging markets as we think they offer the best risk-adjusted prospective returns.\nThe in ation factor and  xed income\nInvestor perceptions of in ation risk have moved quite a lot since the start of the year. Even though we have seen a pick-up\nin cyclical in ation (in the US), the longer- term structural environment points to a low in ation global economy. In developed market government bonds, the reward (risk premium) for taking duration risk remains negative in many of the major developed markets, such as German Bunds, UK Gilts and Japanese government bonds. We therefore remain cautious on developed market government bonds generally,\ngiven that they continue to offer low sustainable returns and face an unfavourable environment, with building cyclical in ation and central bank policy tightening.\nThat said, US Treasury bonds are in a bit\nof a different place, over the short term at least. After a big re-pricing of interest rate expectations over the last twelve months, the risk premium in US Treasuries is now positive. The short end of the curve yields more than the dividend yield on US equities, which has not happened in the last 10 years. The risk reward balance is certainly more attractive than previously, particularly at the short end of the yield curve.\nIn corporate bond markets, credit spreads are offering slightly better value than earlier in the year, but still offer only a slim margin of safety against negative shocks, so we\nmaintain an underweight position in our multi-asset portfolios. Whilst credit quality remains fairly stable, high leverage levels indicate vulnerabilities in some sectors.\nOverall, while investors continue to digest the latest moves on trade protectionism, in ation and interest rates, volatility in markets is likely to remain.\nwww.assetmanagement.hsbc.co.uk\nFor Professional Clients only and should not be distributed to or relied upon by Retail Clients.\nThe value of investments and any income from them can\ngo down as well as up and investors may not get back the amount originally invested.

He is also the sector lead on UK  xed income,  xed income alternatives such as securitised credit, as well as macro/multi asset.\n1. Why are real assets important for investors in today’s market?\nReal asset investments cover a broad group of sub-asset classes such as property, infrastructure, renewable energy, commodities, or asset leasing. In general, they tend to have a combination of the following three characteristics in common:\n• Provide access to investments that can protect against in ation better than traditional asset classes.\n• Offer attractive yields in a low interest rate environment.\n• Act as a source of portfolio diversi cation; a relevant feature when both bond and equity markets are arguably expensive.\nWe believe that investors can improve their risk/return pro le over the long run by including real assets within their alternative allocation bucket.\n2. How would you describe the Architas Diversi ed Real Assets Fund’s investment strategy and what makes this fund different?\nThe fund is an industry-rated* multi-manager solution for investors seeking alternative\nallocations. It is designed for retail investors looking to further diversify their portfolios away from traditional equities and bonds\nby combining a range of alternative sub-\nasset classes and specialist underlying investment funds. With this in mind we have three on-going objectives: diversi cation\nfrom traditional assets, attractive income generation and long-run in ation protection. Our strategy provides access to parts of the market that advisers may not be aware of or perhaps don’t have the experience of investing within. The broad universe of alternatives available means we also see many more complex asset classes that can put investors off, but to us provides opportunity. Most alternative funds target diversi cation, but not all also offer potential for income generation and in ation sensitivity.\n3. Since the fund was launched in 2014, there have been a number of sell-offs in equity markets. How concerning are these bouts of volatility?\nWe have faced several important tests since the inception of the fund in August 2014, and not just from the equity market - the bond market has also had patches of high volatility. These have all had different drivers relevant to the speci c period. Most recently, worries over in ation concerns in the US\nand an increase in political risk has marked an in ection point in market volatility. The fact that the fund is fully unconstrained means that we can construct the portfolio to shelter from the areas of market stresses and incorporate some portfolio hedges to help out.\nIn addition, many of our investments are more sensitive to longer economic cycles than to the shorter-term noise the equity market can bring. Managing a long-only portfolio means that it can be dif cult to generate strong positive returns when most assets are in retreat; however in each case of market volatility we have protected capital well which we see as a positive outcome for the environment.\n4. What’s your outlook?\nWe expect equity market volatility to persist as President Trump seeks to make Americans richer at the expense of the rest of the world. This uncertainty should lead to greater demand for defensive investments, particularly real assets\nthat can also withstand or bene t from in ationary pressures. While this hasn’t been a priority for investors in the post-crisis period, we believe that the combination in the US of robust domestic growth, falling unemployment and greater restrictions\non cheap imports could all contribute to the in ationary pressures that have been building over the past few years.\n Our strategy provides access to parts of the market that advisers may not be aware of or perhaps don’t have the experience of investing within.\n*achieving a  ve diamond rating from Defaqto for multi-asset income.\n "," 25\n  Architas puts platform clients  rst by offering super clean to all\n Sarah Ackland | Head of UK Funds | Architas\nIn a move to offer the best value to advisers using a platform we are making our super clean share classes available to all UK investment platforms. We are currently working closely with your platforms to extend the share classes accessibility so you can offer the best value to your clients.\nPreviously the super clean share class has only been available on Standard Life Elevate and Standard Life Wrap. This will mean a reduction in the annual management charge (AMC) for all other platform clients of 20 basis points (bps) on the Active* and Blended ranges, 5 bps on the Passive fund range and 10 bps on the Diversi ed Real Assets fund compared to the clean share classes.\nExtending our super clean share classes across all platforms will provide better value and more consistent pricing for all clients invested in Architas via third party platforms. We now have advisers using Architas across all the main UK platforms and believe it is right to make the best value pricing available to all platform clients rather than just those using a speci c one.\nDuring the 10 years of Architas we have seen signi cant changes in the market. This includes the growth of multi-asset and multi-manager solutions and demand from advisers for funds that balance risk with potential reward. Given the growth of the business, it is right that we continue to offer competitive and value for money solutions for our clients.\nThis move will also simplify the situation if you are switching clients between platforms or using multiple platforms as part of your investment proposition. Having consistent pricing also removes the additional costs you face if you wish to switch platforms and want to remain invested in Architas funds.

When I started analysing funds in the late 1980s, most investors were unlikely to know much about the individuals and teams running their money but many now have high pro les with consumers as well as advisers. And while we might have pulled back from the peak star manager era – there are no more 10-feet high managers on billboards up and down the country – the trend remains well established.\nThis tends to lead to intense scrutiny when particular managers leave, with widespread debate, particularly in the press, over whether investors should buy or sell. As holders of Nigel Thomas in our portfolios, we are facing such a decision now but while we often invest in funds based\non certain individuals, we have always\ncounselled patience when it comes to moving on if a manager departs.\nResearch published by Morningstar last year focuses on the aftermath of fund management departures and comes to the surprising conclusion that, on average, there is no signi cant change in future performance.\n“Yet investors overreact and subsequently pull money from these funds: our  ndings suggest that the fund industry handles succession planning far better than investors react to such changes,” the group said.\nInvestors might disagree based on certain instances in the past – a certain high-pro le manager giving up a Special Situations fund after 25 years in the mid- 2000s for example – but I would agree there is too much knee-jerk selling when big-name managers leave.\nGoing back to Morningstar, the rating agency said investors need to think twice before acting on a manager change,\nasking whether a fund is one of the “few remaining where the strategy and manager are outside the norm, truly run by a personality or highly specialised individual”.\n When I started analysing funds in the late 1980s, most investors were unlikely to know much about the individuals and teams running their money but many now have high pro les with consumers as well as advisers.\n "," 27\n  Research published by Morningstar last year focuses on the aftermath of fund management departures and comes to the surprising conclusion that, on average, there is no signi cant change in future performance.\nIn most cases, it concludes, the answer is no. The most surprising part of the paper is Morningstar’s candid reaction to its own track record on manager changes, admitting it has often been unnecessary when it has put funds on watch lists.\n“From our study, we  nd that we do not need to downgrade a fund every time there is a management change if we feel con dent in the parent, the process and the cost,’” it added. “We do need\nto identify cases where there is a policy change in the fund’s strategy versus simply a management change.”\nFor me, the key part of this statement\nis the focus on the parent company and the process – and this very much chimes with our thinking about consistency of process being a prerequisite across our holdings. While a particular investment process is often associated with a speci c manager, there is nothing to suggest it cannot pass to successors if the underlying infrastructure is suf ciently robust.\nAs stated, fund buyers have a tendency to react negatively to manager changes, often wanting to follow the departing individual onto pastures new. But thinking twice about the succession plans in\nplace, particularly with funds from larger investment houses, may save more than time and additional transaction costs.\nLooking at a recent example, Ed Legget left Standard Life Investments for Artemis\nin 2015, passing the SLI UK Equity Unconstrained Fund back to its  rst manager Wes McCoy.\nReviewing the numbers head to head\nsince Legget took up the reins of Artemis UK Select puts McCoy’s fund marginally behind over the past two years. The\nmore interesting story, however, is the similarity in the pattern of returns, with both stockpickers underperforming in 2016 and then among the best in the peer group over the past year.\nThere will clearly be particular instances where selling a fund when the manager leaves is ultimately the right call for investors. But given the work many groups are putting into succession planning – particularly for top-level managers who have been in place for many years – it is worth taking time over these decisions and not immediately rushing for the exit.\nKey risks & disclaimer\nLiontrust Fund Partners LLP (2 Savoy Court, London WC2R 0EZ), authorised and regulated in the UK by the Financial Conduct Authority (FRN 518165) to undertake regulated investment business.\nPlease remember that past performance is not a guide to future performance and the value of an investment and any income generated from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed, therefore you may not get back the amount originally invested and potentially risk total loss of capital.\nThis document should not be construed as advice for investment in any product or security mentioned, an offer to buy or sell units/shares of Funds mentioned, or a solicitation\nto purchase securities in any company or investment product.

The paper discusses key challenges and opportunities, old and new, for a range of market stakeholders and participants. The paper also illustrates, through market research, the thoughts, behaviours and requirements of customers and advisers.\nIn this feature, we summarise some of the key themes from the paper including some headline  ndings from the adviser market research.\nFreedoms are good for business\nLet’s start with the easy bit. The pension freedoms changes have largely been good news for advisers. AKG’s research showed that 77% of advisers are spending more time/resource on the provision of retirement advice since the introduction of pension freedoms.\nAreas of concern for advice businesses\nHowever, advisers are clearly concerned about the potential impact of Regulatory change/challenge (77%) and Political volatility (47%) on their businesses. Advisers\nalso expressed concern about Investment volatility (59%), a recurring theme for the paper, and Capacity/resource for their business (28%).\nNew business sources for advisers - client segments\nPredictably,  nding it uneconomical to do so, advisers are unlikely to service those with retirement funds of £50,000. AKG’s research indicates that the ‘sweet spots’ are those clients at retirement with funds between £100,000 to £250,000 and those with more than £250,000.\nAcknowledging the changing pro le of drawdown\nHistorically, drawdown business was conducted solely through intermediaries and with typical minimum product\nentrance requirements of c.£250,000. ABI data, however, now points towards an average drawdown fund of under £70,000. Drawdown is therefore being used by more customers with lower retirement funds than was previously the case.\nNow, without the GAD framework in place for withdrawals, it will be interesting to monitor exactly how drawdown is being utilised by customers.\nFor example, has it been picked just because it is perceived to be more  exible than annuities? Is it being used to strip out cash, in a tax ef cient manner, over the short- to mid-term? Is it being used for the provision of income over the longer term, to be underpinned by an investment portfolio? Or a combination of these factors?\n ","29\n   AKG’s research showed that 77% of advisers are spending more time/ resource on the provision of retirement advice since the introduction of pension freedoms.\nAnd so, there is huge potential for advisers\nto deliver comprehensive and valued retirement planning services to clients, with many of these planning strategies involving drawdown. Advisers will need to use all\ntheir skills, and employ a range of solutions in their toolkit, to optimise these planning opportunities and achieve positive retirement outcomes for clients.\nUnderstanding key planning concerns for advisers\nBut what is on advisers’ minds in relation\nto their clients? In AKG’s market research with advisers we asked, “What are your main investment/planning concerns for clients at- or post-retirement?”\nThe top four concerns were:\n1. ‘Investment volatility’ - 48%\n2. ‘Running out of money’ - 45%\n3. ‘Sequencing of investment return\nrisk’ - 41%\n4. ‘Longevity risk’ - 36%\nSome fundamental issues for consideration here, all arguably linked in some way to the sustainability of retirement funds. This will certainly remain an area of focus for the market, on both the adviser and provider side, during 2018/19 and beyond.\nAnd for these reasons, despite the slightly low ebb for provision of such solutions post- freedoms, there is likely to remain a case for the role of annuities and other forms of guarantees in the market in future years.\nFrom an investment perspective, the composition and performance of drawdown portfolios will remain front of mind.\nAdviser requirements from providers\nIn AKG’s market research with advisers we asked, “What are the key requirements for providers to be successful with advisers in the pensions/retirement market following the introduction of pension freedoms?”\nThe top  ve were:\n1. ‘Service delivery standards’ - 58%\n2. ‘Range of product/fund solutions’ - 54% 3. ‘Financial strength/sustainability’ - 48% 4. ‘Digital/online capability and\nfunctionality’ - 45%\n5. ‘Technical support (tax/pensions)’ - 33%\nThe importance of being able to deliver on core business competencies and disciplines is hammered home here for providers who want to be successful with advisers.\nIdentifying areas for development/ improvement\nAKG was also keen to explore with advisers where they would like to see further development or improvement. Our market research with advisers therefore asked, “In which areas would you most like to see further development or improvement in the pensions/ retirement market during 2018/19?”\nThe top  ve were:\n1. ‘Drawdown products’ - 46%\n2. ‘Guaranteed capital/income\nsolutions’ - 31%\n3. ‘Cost of products/funds/portfolios’ - 29%\n4. ‘Digital/online capability and\nfunctionality’ - 25%\n5. ‘Value of products/funds/portfolios’ - 24%\nDespite the early dominance of drawdown post-freedoms, advisers want to see further product development. It is also interesting\nto see potential appetite for development or improvement in guaranteed capital/income solutions.\nIt is unsurprising to see a focus on cost and value of products/funds/portfolios given the regulatory focus on value for money. We will continue to see pressure on cost across the value chain, especially on the wrapper and investment management components of drawdown.\nImproved digital/online capability and functionality is  agged here, as well as in the  ndings about adviser requirements from providers, and so businesses simply cannot afford to underestimate this requirement to invest and progress capability in this area.\nMore experience to be gained\nWithout exception, the pension freedom changes caught people by surprise. The changes have also coincided with a wider period of regulatory and political change and challenge. So, what we have seen initially\nis three years of adjustment to the new freedoms with further work to be done in 2018/19 and beyond.\nThe number of ‘baby boomers’ approaching retirement is well documented, many of whom are yet to make their retirement decisions. Advisers and providers across the market must therefore continue to learn quickly from those customers experiencing the initial stages of pension freedoms to better target future business opportunities and enhancements to services.\nFor a variety of reasons, the pensions/ retirement market has become, and will remain, a fascinating place in which to transact business and to serve customers over the coming years.\n ","      30\n                             Win, lose or withdraw?\n Andrzej Pioch | Fund Manager | Legal & General Investment Management\nHow fast can retirees sustainably draw down their retirement funds? That is a question which has caused much debate and anxiety in recent years, especially following the introduction of ‘pension freedoms’.\nWe see three factors which affect the rate of drawdown as most worthy of consideration:\nAsset drivers - Spending drivers -\nAttitude to risk - Asset drivers\nThe size of funds held and their risk and return characteristics\nDemands on your capital such as one-off lump sums e.g. once-in-a-lifetime cruises or  nancial support| for children or grandchildren trying to get on the housing ladder\nHow much risk we’re prepared to take, both in terms of short-term volatility and the longer-term risk of the fund running dry\nSize of retirement fund\nA fund that’s twice as big as another can support double the withdrawals (before tax) with all else being equal.\nExpected return\nInterest rates are a key driver of the expected return of any fund. In general, the higher interest rates are, the higher the level of income a given size of fund can support, rather like annuity rates being higher when interest rates are too.\nThe expected return from the chosen investment strategy over and above interest rates depends on both the asset allocation and views on those asset classes (there is no right answer). All else being equal, a higher expected rate of return affords a higher income.\nUncertain returns\nHowever, we need to tread carefully, as higher returns generally come with higher risk. The degree of investment return uncertainty depends on the asset allocation strategy. Generally, strategies targeting higher returns will be more volatile; for example, investors allocating more to emerging market equities should typically expect a bumpier ride than\nthose favouring government bonds. All else being equal, greater volatility leads to an increased risk of running out of money.\nSpending drivers\nAge\nAs retirees age, it becomes safer to withdraw a greater percentage of the remaining\nfund each year as the risk of outliving their retirement fund (longevity risk) decreases.\nFor pure income drawdown investors, the only way to protect against this longevity risk is to ‘self-insure’ by withdrawing income at a ‘prudent’ or ‘sustainable’ rate. However, the problem is that in old age the degree of\n ","  31\n                                The degree of investment return uncertainty depends on the asset allocation strategy. Generally, strategies targeting higher returns will be more volatile; for example, investors allocating more to emerging market equities should typically expect a bumpier ride than those favouring government bonds.\nprudence required can become crippling, pushing the sustainable rate below that available from an annuity. This may make annuitisation appear more attractive with age. Moreover, as we age, we may also favour a greater degree of simplicity.\nHealth\nBeing in poor health could be akin to retirees effectively being older (in terms of the mortality rates they are exposed to) than their years. Plainly the diverse range of retirees’ health circumstances underlines how different pension investors can have widely- differing needs.\nSpending patterns\nThese will vary hugely across individuals. However, most individuals are exposed to similar drivers. Some of these drivers act\nto increase spending over time, such as the need for in ation protection, and long- term care costs. In contrast, others tend to decrease spending. For example, pensioners tend to become less active over time. Some advisers like to think of a U-shaped spending pattern in retirement – outgoings decreasing at  rst (adjusted for in ation) but then tending to increase in advanced age. However, some researchers have expressed doubts over this pattern.\nInheritance matters\nInheritance goals are usually only a secondary objective, other than for those with the luxury of very substantial pension funds. However, our discussions with IFAs/ wealth managers dealing with high net worth individuals suggest that inheritance objectives are becoming increasingly relevant to some investors.\nOther sources of income\nMany retirees will qualify for a state pension. In practice, access to such a backstop income in uences other risk preferences – investors are often more willing to take greater risks with their pension funds if they have another source of regular income to fall back on, particularly if it is guaranteed (such as a de ned bene t pension).\nAttitude to risk\nIn the absence of annuitisation, investors bear both investment risk (given that,\nin general the return that will be earned\non assets is not known in advance) and longevity risk (given that nobody knows their date of death in advance). This effectively rules out the ‘perfect’ scenario for many retirees, namely that they get to enjoy every last penny just before their time comes. Retirees need to adapt their investment strategy and their withdrawal rates over\ntime to handle these risks. However, exactly how they adapt will depend on their attitude to risk. A retiree who’s more willing to run the risk of exhausting their pension fund might be prepared to take money out more quickly. At the other extreme, those who want to play things ultra-safe would take the annuitisation route and accept the lower consequent income.\nImportant Notice:\nThis is not a consumer advertisement.

The importance of cash ow modelling has exploded over a short space of time to become one of the most important adviser tools-of the-trade. Its relative simplicity belies its power to produce graphs that can easily communicate complex  nancial scenarios and help resolve sophisticated compliance challenges.\nThere are reasons that cash ow modelling has taken centre stage and it is worth looking at a couple of these before focussing on a couple of features that help Synaptic Analyser stand out. Many advisers generate graphs from spreadsheets, and these perform just as valid a function as our software, but Synaptic Analyser does a lot more.\nIt should also be said that many providers and platforms have cash ow modelling tools accessible. However, in the new world, accessing resources from an organisation that will also provide you with custody/ investment solutions will create a possible con ict of interest with your research and, at least, provide an additional burden of proving that the decisions you make have not been unduly in uenced. The FCA calls it ‘channelling’ (see COBS 2.3.1 (Rules on Inducements)), and any coincidence around signi cant in ows into a provider/platform, and use of their tools will raise concerns.\nIn the recent report ‘An ex-regulator’s guide to cash- ow planning’ (you can buy it online and we would recommend it), Rory Percival is unequivocal about the importance of cash-  ow plans. He provided an additional couple of points of clari cation that I think will really help a lot of clients:\n• “Cash- ow planning can be about any form of income and outgoings and does not have to relate to the client’s overall position.” A cash- ow plan need not be a holistic view of a client’s  nances.\n• The second point is that the cash- ow plan can establish a client’s Capacity for Loss. In fact, writes the author ‘it should be the main way of assessing capacity for loss for most clients.’ Capacity for Loss is the lynchpin of compliance and meeting the funding requirements for future income is central to any plan. An adviser needs to make an expert, objective\nassessment of Capacity for Loss, or using its FCA de nition, identify the level at which loss may make a ‘material impact on the standard of living’.\nSomething can also be said about drawdown and ‘sustainable income’. Since pension freedoms changed everything in 2015, and GAD-based guidelines are no longer used to determine suitability of drawdown strategies, advisers have had to master the research required to illustrate ‘sustainable’ retirement income strategies. Rory Percival rightly outlines the importance of ensuring the ‘longevity of funds’ to fund a retirement plan. Consistent with a client’s Capacity for Loss, he explains the role that stochastic modelling may play in demonstrating longevity. Rather than providing a stochastic analysis within Analyser itself, we prefer to direct our customers to our Modeller tool to explore longevity (sustainability) using the Moody’s model. We do however have plans to extend\n ","    33\n                               Accessing resources from an organisation that will also provide you with custody/investment solutions will create a possible con ict of interest with your research and at least, provide an additional burden of proving that the decisions you make have not been unduly in uenced.\nour stochastic analysis of the cash ow planning in Analyser in due course.\nAlthough the cash- ow model is designed to illustrate possibilities linked to the invested elements of a plan, i.e. pensions, ISAs and GIAs, the part of the Synaptic Analyser tool that our customers seem to appreciate most is the ability to include additional sources\nof income, for example state pension, buy- to-let property or wages. This makes the outputs far more useful from a client-facing perspective.\nFinancial planning is made easier on a number of levels with Synaptic Analyser:\n• Real  exibility comes with the ability\nto save multiple scenarios, which are essential to help provide stress tests and what if scenarios;\n• Direct access to accurate (including enhanced) annuity quotes makes any planning around ‘secured’ income a lot easier;\n• A dashboard that provides calculations on ‘investment required’ and ‘maximum income’ from investments included;\n• Integration of accurate quotes from a range of providers helps complete the research process.\nComing soon\nQ4 2018 will see the addition of ‘Phased drawdown’ capability for the Synaptic Analyser tool.\n The screenshot above shows how data relevant to the recommendation can be accessible in one screen, capturing all the key facets of retirement planning and allowing ‘on-the- y’ editing of inputs.

A year to remember, whether for Orwellian reasons, Band Aid, or perhaps the launch of the UK’s  rst fully ethical fund, Friends Provident’s Stewardship fund.\nIt reminds me of the hours I spent training up on that new fund when I worked in\none of their satellite of ces.

There’s the in-vogue security of one’s data, not to mention the corruption and business ethics that we hear about.\nTo highlight the changing face of ethical investment, last year witnessed a record investment of around £100bn into active ethical funds, and in March this year alone, investors placed £138m into ethical funds, over 430% up on the amount invested during March 20171.\nFlagged as an area of interest, this publication ran an article in January 2016, entitled ‘Ethical investing – value as well as values’. Indeed, a six-month snapshot of data taken from Synaptic’s Product & Fund tool between December 2017 and May 2018\nhighlighted that out of over 3,000 pieces of unit trust research conducted, 9% of cases selected the ethical  ag.\nSynaptic currently maintains ethical policy data for over a thousand funds. We are seeing advisers actively encouraging more fund managers to push ethical data to us,\nas they increasingly utilise Product and\nFund to screen for more ethical funds. Technological advances and enhanced analytics are allowing Synaptic to receive and provide better ethical data than ever before. This means that we can offer transparent\n Let’s take Millennials as an example. The next big  nancial event they will bene t from is the £6trn inheritance windfall heading their way over the next 20 years or so, and it is this group who have already formed strong connections with the ethical aspects of their everyday lives.\n1.

We all want to contribute to saving our planet (beyond owning a bag for life!), but often, and I know I do this, we think “how can I, on my own, make such a difference if no-one else follows suit?”.\nWe are now also acutely aware of the heightened pro le new demographics such as Millennials and Generation Z enjoy. Through increasing media coverage, we are quickly learning that they are fast becoming  nancial powerhouses. Let’s take Millennials as an example. The next big  nancial event they will bene t from is the £6trn inheritance windfall heading their way over the next 20 years or so, and it is this group who have already formed strong connections with the ethical aspects of their everyday lives.\nMany Millennials already donate to campaigns and charities, or volunteer their services to various social, environmental or political causes. It should come as no surprise then that they recognise investment success\nshould not only be measured by the  nancial performance of their portfolio, but a longer term view of sustainability.\nIf this is a commonly shared view, as an adviser, how often are you obliged to expand your customers’ grasp of what exactly sustainable or ethical investment means, and what the differences between ESG research and Sustainable and Responsible Investment (SRI) products are?\nESG and SRI are abbreviations often used in the same breath but they do have different roles to play. There has been an argument claiming that investments integrating with key ESG factors return poor performance, however recent studies have started to dispel that myth proving that ethical funds are demonstrating lower risk and outperforming portfolios over the medium to long term.\nSo, what is the difference? Put simply, ESG dictates the impact its practices have on the performance of an investment. Their integration is designed to enhance the more traditional  nancial analysis by identifying potential risks and opportunities. Only when society plays a part will  nancial performance remain the main objective of the ESG evaluation.\nSRI goes one step further. Screening actively eliminates or selects investments according to speci c ethical guidelines. Underpinning this could be your customer’s religion, their personal values and/or political beliefs.\nPerhaps the idea of ethical investment isn’t nuts after all. Millennials certainly don’t\nthink so, but the question remains, “Can we keep pace with the demands of all ethical investors, no matter which demographic they belong to, and how much they have available to invest?”.\nSynaptic continues to offer up-to-date fund knowledge.

Z\n  Paul Quarendon | New Product Development Manager | Synaptic Software Limited\nThey were born into the digital age and have never known life without the internet. They have a world of information at their  ngertips and they want it quicker than the Millennium Falcon made the Kessel run. They are Generation Z.\nThe children of Generation X, born into this cohort in the mid-1990’s, are now entering the workplace and developing their own opinions on  nance, politics and health in the here and now, and for the future. So far, they have been shaped by advancements\nin technology, and have much more access to, and are keenly aware of, global political events and the impact these have on society. All of this will have had a fundamental impact on Gen Z’s attitude towards life and future values so it should be no surprise that they have different mindsets and behaviours to previous generations when in their early stages of life.\nThere are important differences between them and their Generation X parents, who sat astride the world of pre-technology and this brave new world of social media. Also known as “digital natives,” they are growing up with smartphones, tablets and laptops as omnipresent necessities in their everyday activities.\nIt is becoming abundantly clear that the maturity shown in their decision making\nis something you would more commonly associate with those in older generations,\nbut Gen Z hold strong beliefs fuelled by information accessible via the internet. Their attitude to health is one. They have lived through economic downswings, so health cover has become particularly important (and extremely marketable) to them. They do seem worried or concerned about the impact technology will have throughout their lifetime, which means health and  tness will be areas they will want to focus on when thinking about sustaining an active lifestyle. Research has revealed that Gen Z are more likely to pay a premium to look after their health than any other current demographic which demonstrates clearly that this presents clear opportunities to play to one of their key characteristics – stability and security.\nSo, how do we successfully reach out to Generation Z? Well, they continue to make themselves constantly available via their smartphone and instant messaging apps. The perceived downside to that is they apparently have an attention span of just eight seconds,\nso any messages we do get through need to be short, sharp and immediately to the point. They’re not necessarily an impatient bunch but they have a desire to make fast and valuable decisions.\nEmployers are already starting to get on\nthe front foot, recognising the potential in altering working patterns to  t with the Gen Z workforce. Businesses will look upon these changes as ideal ways to promote loyalty and support, but, beware; like Millennials, organisations must act ethically to attract Gen Z, and this will be mirrored in the way  nancial companies acquit themselves when trying to meet the needs of this new population.\nIs it therefore wise to talk to Gen Z before we develop systems and procedures to meet their needs? We are blessed with so much research on the internet, it feels like we already know everything about them, but wherever our research and ingenuity takes us, at the heart of our energy should be the emotion of the purchaser, and their need to cover certain scenarios.\n ","    37\n                               Whichever pedestal we choose to put Gen Z on, they have been known to be fully conversant in using a tablet before being able to tie a shoe lace, before being able to swim and even before they are able to tell the time!\nIt’s fair to say, not many of them will be purchasing their own properties quite yet, but they will be renting, presenting the  nancial services industry with a potentially lucrative protection proposition. Will this signal the boon Income Protection needs? Given it is likely that a Gen Z’s  rst job will no longer be a rite of passage into a long- term career with the same employer, (as\nwas the case with many Baby Boomers and some Millennials), in a couple of years’ time the career ladder will come calling, as will a higher earning capacity. Protection can play a signi cant part in providing that ‘stability and security’ they crave.\nSo, in summary, what are the key challenges we need to face head on if we want to tap into this future  nancial powerhouse:\n• Their use of multiple media presents a challenge – what is the best way to engage them?\n• Does Gen Z know what the insurance industry can offer and how it can help them in the future?\n• Security is crucial, so Facebook may not be the platform to engage with them. Gen Z has seen some other generations get burned by social media scandals and identify theft. We must all be able to safeguard sensitive data.\n• They will, however, still want to learn about new products via social media. The ability to personalise, streamline and simplify communications with them via quick, visual content in video will be vital.\nTo round off, here’s something you may  nd startling. Whichever pedestal we choose to put Gen Z on, they have been known to be fully conversant in using a tablet before being able to tie a shoe lace, before being able to swim and even before they are able to tell the time!\nSynaptic has recently joined up with COVER Magazine to produce an e-book focussing on innovation in the digital space for protection.

Without asset allocation, any consideration of risk would fall down, because there would be no basis of assumption for the likely growth of the asset classes that make up a portfolio, or their likely interaction in the various possible economic scenarios that we are able to foresee.\nNo expert judgement around suitability would be possible, nor would any sensible predictions of investment outcomes. All\nthe major trends that drive the returns of our retail customers are rooted in the asset allocation models that reside at the heart of any  rm’s investment strategy.\nOne beauty of asset allocation is that the framework can accommodate any style\nof investment. Synaptic has had a long collaboration with RSMR, whose qualitative commentary provides insights into funds and managers that have become hugely in uential. All our major adviser groups rely on this commentary to help direct their fund choices to a greater or lesser extent. Large cap/small cap, global/local, Emerging/ Frontier, high yield, long/short duration, sovereign/corporate, convertible, hedged, smart beta, ETF/OEIC, multi asset or DFM...\nthese are all the everyday concerns of those seeking investment returns, but all  t into the framework provided by asset allocation, which is used to map an ef cient frontier balancing investment return forecast against risk.\nThe ef cient frontier was a concept that helped revolutionise investment and we still adhere to the principles today. In his Modern Portfolio Theory, economist Harry Markowitz demonstrated how the correlation co- ef cients between various asset classes could be used to optimise an asset class blend to maximise portfolio returns.\nMarkovitz’ research has been used as a starting point by research specialists such\nas Moody’s Analytics (formerly Barrie + Hibbert), who can now produce probability- based projections of all viable economic scenarios and asset class growth trajectories.\nThe engine that produces these models is integrated into the Synaptic Modeller tool. By accessing these projections, advisers have access to all the metrics they need to prove suitability and hopefully delight their clients. This investment risk management approach offers:\n• A consistent and proven approach to balancing risk and return;\n• The extent to which losses in a bad year (1 in 20) will fall, allowing the adviser to accommodate the client’s Capacity for Loss with the chosen investment;\n• Reliable, research-based portfolio growth rate assumptions, that will allow a realistic plan to be formulated in line with objectives.\n ","    41\n                           One beauty of asset allocation is that the framework can accommodate any style of investment.\nThis mathematical modelling is done using simulation (Monte Carlo) where thousands of outcomes are generated and analysed,\na technique also referred to as stochastic modelling. The accuracy of the model comes from the success that Moody’s have had in building the rules that underpin\nthe simulation. This implies of course the truth that not every model is a good one, so be careful which one you adopt. The proof is in the pudding, and Moody’s have been proven for accuracy over many years including the 2008 downturn. Moody’s (uniquely) attributed an accurate probability and loss to the event, meaning that clients of Synaptic and Moody’s should not have been unduly concerned with losses as they occurred at that time and remain invested, in line with the FCA’s guidance on risk and Capacity for Loss. The model is presented to advisers in terms of Value at Risk and these measurements form the boundaries of the Synaptic risk categories. Value at Risk is a more valuable metric to advisers than drawdown or volatility per se.\nAs well as having access to a framework constructed of Strategic Asset Allocations, advisers can review asset allocations\nof existing investments and project on recommendations that they wish to make. The ability to illustrate the risk and return characteristics of these investments, and frame them in the context of a company’s investment strategy, makes the challenge of compliance in the MiFID age manageable.\nHow is a strategic asset allocation created? The graph (above right) shows output of simulation, hot off the press, used to de ne the Level 1, Cautious Portfolio in the new Synaptic 1-10 range.\nFor Portfolio 1 we had four candidates. Portfolio ‘test 10’ was selected as it had the best risk/return characteristics (i.e. target was 4.4% 1year VAR, this was lower and had the better projected return).\n To identify the Synaptic Risk strategic asset allocation boundaries, Moody’s uses 6 core asset classes (although the Synaptic version of the engine can process up to 22 asset classes including various  xed income asset classes which include high yield corporate bonds and index-linked bonds, global equities, commodities, infrastructure and hedge funds).\nProcessing these strategic asset allocations creates our ef cient frontier based on risk metrics that look like this:\n Asset allocation name\n Term\n Type\n Boundaries - Min Gain\n   Max Gain\n Mean Gain\n Risk Rating\n  Cautious\n  10\n   Strategic\n -5.27\n   11.44\n 2.93\n   < 2.0\n Moderately Cautious\n 10\n Strategic\n -10.71\n 18.25\n 3.92\n < 3.0\n Balanced\n  10\n  Strategic\n  -14.7\n  23.99\n  5.22\n  < 4.0\n  Moderately Adventurous\n 10\n  Strategic\n-18.19\n  28.85\n6.15\n  < 5.0\n Adventurous\n  10\n  Strategic\n  -22.6\n  36.43\n  7.36\n  < 6.0\n  The ef cient frontier for the Moody’s/Synaptic model has the advantage of being constructed around potential loss (so Value at Risk), rather than the more usual volatility bands.\n "," 42\n The bene t of the Moody’s approach is that the model represents every viable investment outcome, including all sequence of returns. The simulation aspect of the exercise harnesses the power of probability through the generation of thousands of scenarios.\n                              MiFID watchers will have been horri ed\nat the guidance put forward in those directives that allows for investment growth assumptions to be made by averaging previous years’ performance. Just looking\nat a table of asset class returns shows how impossible it is to predict returns in the short term by looking at past performance. It is only by stretching the term and capturing the trends and behaviours correctly that our projections become meaningful.\nThe bene t of the Moody’s approach is that the model represents every viable investment outcome, including all sequence of returns. The simulation aspect of the exercise harnesses the power of probability through the generation of thousands of scenarios. Stochastic modelling was a bit of a joke a few years ago in the mainstream (though certainly not at institutional level\n– for example Moody’s have been used by Royal London for years). Not anymore, as practitioners start to appreciate that the probabilistic approach leads to far more reliable forecasting, and the ability to embed a transparent process means that advice becomes consistent and reporting is made possible for compliance purposes.\nAsset allocation becomes a prism to evaluate any and every portfolio. In the rear pages of this magazine, you will see a wide range of fund groups who have participated in our risk rating. The Synaptic Risk Ratings are calculated by verifying the asset allocation\nof the investment with the asset manager, and projecting using the Moody’s stochastic engine. This is mapped to the Moody’s ef cient frontier, giving us a risk pro le that can be correctly mapped to the risk appetite of the client. The Strategic Asset Allocations have been developed to align perfectly with the ATRQ provided.\nNotice that the methodology is different\nto the others in the market, who are less con dent of their ability to project asset classes and therefore provide a committee- based ‘rating’ rather than a research-based rating. The problem of this, in our view, is that it removes the perspective of the adviser or investment committee, who should be providing the ‘qualitative overlay’ (with the assistance of RSMR’s insights). The Moody’s approach also means that the adviser\nhas an objective means of monitoring an investment, rather than relying on a rating agency whose culture is to obscure the underlying dynamics and play down the  uidity of the risk universe.\nSee above for an example of how the Risk metrics make up the Synaptic risk ratings for Brewin Dolphin MPS portfolios. The ‘min gain’ is used to map to the boundaries of the risk categories. It is also the Value at Risk which must be matched to the client’s Capacity for Loss.\n   ","                              Another great bene t of working with Moody’s stochastic model is the ability to model in ation. This is a thorny challenge for advisers, because\nof the dif culty of gaining a useful model for in ation, and illustrations that accurately capture the ravages of in ation are not useful sales aids(!), unless the adviser is shown the likely impact of in ation on a cash holding as a point of comparison. This focusses the mind on the value of investment as a means of protecting wealth over the long term. Moody’s calculate the impact of in ation historically to average 4.5% loss per year, in any 10-year period. The illustration (top right) indicates an 85% likelihood of losing money on 10-year cash investment (without costs!). The average return in the model at £8.6k is not as\nbad as in real life, as we are using the investment de nition of cash as short dated bonds (1-year government bonds which have a greater growth potential than cash in the bank).\nPutting it all together, for research purposes\nyou can combine the projections of the asset allocations that underpin your advice. We are looking at the Strategic Asset Allocation, the allocation of the recommended investment, and we are overlaying costs and in ation for the full, beautifully compliant picture.\nThe next results (right) show the value of advice\n– an 85% chance of losing money has become\nan 60% chance of making money. Now if some charges could be shaved off, the picture starts\nto look more like our nominal projection (over 90% chance of gains)... but that is another story. The recommendation here was using a 10-year projection with 1.1% costs (adviser charges, platform and fund). Remember the ‘min gain value’ is our Value at Risk amount, the extent of the losses expected in a ‘bad year’, de ned as 1 in 20 (5%) – enabling us to make our Capacity for Loss assessment with credible values. The blue\nline shows the projected returns of our strategic Balanced allocation. The green line shows the asset allocation of our recommended investment. The red line is the latter includes costs and in ation.\nFor more information on any of the above, including access to the Synaptic Modeller tool or the Risk ratings (free), please call us on 0800 783

You should consult Royal London directly for further information before recommending.\nAbout the service: Synaptic Risk Ratings are worked out by analysing the underlying asset classes within the fund or portfolio. Synaptic Software have requested asset allocation information from participating providers in a specific format aligned to the risk framework of the system. These asset classes are used by the model to determine the risk rating, a process that may result in a level of approximation though in most cases this will be insignificant. It is also possible that certain asset classes may not be represented exactly in the manner that providers would prefer.\nReasonable endeavours are made to provide accuracy and consistency, however neither participating providers nor Synaptic Software can be held responsible for any errors or omissions. No recommendation should be made solely on the basis of the Synaptic Risk Ratings, and additional research should be undertaken for any case. This service is intended for use by investment professionals only.\n","      SYNAPTIC RISK\nProvides fund and portfolio risk ratings underpinned by the industry’s leading risk expertise\n                        Synaptic Risk is an integral part of the Synaptic Suite available to all financial advisers.
