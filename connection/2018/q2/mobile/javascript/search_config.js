Towards the end of last year, we underwent a restructure to put resources in place to improve the software you use at a time of increasing regulation and oversight. This is now complete.\nThe  rst challenge that the new team has addressed is the new regulation around data protection known as ‘GDPR’, affecting all software and data companies. Now that this work is complete, we are able to address a range of improvements for the Synaptic suite.\nToday’s headline was that advisers are earning more than ever before. This feels counterintuitive given the challenges advisers are facing, but it is a tribute to improving professional standards. It also re ects a generous bull market (for now) and a large number of retirees with signi cant savings and assets looking for homes following the 2015 pension freedoms. A lot of the editorial content in this magazine relates to advice and investment in the context of pensions and retirement. Synaptic research is becoming increasingly relevant in the emerging compliance environment, especially given\nour strength in investment risk management through our risk rating service; and the success of our new cash ow modelling tool, Synaptic Analyser.\nThis magazine showcases some of the very best products, providers, asset managers and solutions for advisers across the industry, and we are delighted to welcome HSBC to our\nfold in more than one guise. Firstly, as we launch the HSBC Life term product on Webline, making this product widely available to our customers, and secondly and coincidentally, supporting the Global Asset Management business as we provide risk ratings to some of their multi-asset range, visible to our 8,000 adviser software subscribers. Our business also provides mortgage administration software to HSBC in the UK, so it de nitely feels like an achievement to be partnering in these different but related spheres.

This article is chie y about not being seduced by headlines that prophesise the future state of the platform market by looking at a single  nancial metric – such as pro t & loss – in isolation. Pro t. Prophet. See? SEE! Sorry.\nFirst, a disclaimer. There has been a signi cant industry focus over the past few years on\nthe pro t and loss (P&L) activity of advised platforms. And we understand this. Platforms, once industry disrupter, are now  rmly the incumbent. And with that disruption came (sometimes extraordinary) bills for technology installations and upgrades, generating understandable headlines.\nI’m also not arguing that pro t and loss\nisn’t an important element of  nancial assessment. Far from it. Any business that posts persistent losses is a cause for concern on some level. But, and this is the important bit, we  rmly believe that an earnest comparison of P&L activity in isolation can be a very crude measurement, and that using it as the only  nancial metric on which to base a rating or choice of platform isn’t sophisticated enough.\nDifferent strokes\nSuccess in life means different things to different people and that certainly applies to the range of platforms in the adviser space. The peer group that we look at is made up of a diverse range of organisations, each with different success factors. And when assessing their  nancial performance, here’s some of the critical factors that I reckon you need to get to grips with.\n• USE COMPANIES HOUSE WITH CAUTION: Some platforms are (relatively) straightforward entities\nbut others are a different beast, doing awkwardly awkward things like reporting pension assets via a different set of accounts to other business (the likes of Old Mutual Wealth and Aviva)\n• ASSET ARM: does the platform have an asset manager sister company within the same group? i.e. does the  nancial\nperformance of the wider entity bene t from monies  owing to an in-house range?\n• MULTI-CHANNEL: does the platform hold assets relating to other markets such as D2C/workplace/institutional or does\nit distribute purely through the individual retail advice channel?\n• ADVICE: does the platform/parent company own its own advice channels (such as Standard Life Aberdeen (1825) or Old Mutual Wealth (Intrinsic) or hold assets from restricted/strategic/white label deals (Succession on IFDL and Openwork on Zurich for example).\n• MEET THE PARENTS: is the platform part of a wider organisation, such as Zurich Intermediary Platform, or is it a stand- alone business?\n  ","  5\n           If you start to look at the platform players through this lens then a different picture starts to emerge. Let’s look at a few examples in more detail.\nNucleus: the platform is the main commercial entity. It distributes solely through  nancial advisers and is yet to get into asset management manufacturing\nor owning a slice of the advice chain. You could make an argument that an element of vertical integration-lite is at play, given much of the shareholding is held by Nucleus-using advisers. But that’s probably just us being\na bit awkward. Regardless of that, you can pretty much boil the success of Nucleus in its current guise down to one sentence - attracting sustainable advised business that will in turn generate revenue for Nucleus from platform charges.\nLet’s pop down to Bath and have a look at Ascentric – which in many ways is similar to Nucleus in terms of its centre of gravity, being an independent, wrapper and investment agnostic platform. Assessing its  nancial outlook is more nuanced though. Firstly, it is a marketing brand of Investment Funds Direct LTD (IFDL) and one must be mindful of other assets within the IFDL umbrella (such as the Succession book) that is reported via the IFDL entity. And there’s also the small matter of Ma and Pa Pelican, with the wider Royal London fraternity being more than capable of absorbing recent Ascentric re-platforming costs.\nLastly, let’s have a gander at Standard Life Wrap (SLW): SLW is just one entity within\nthe wider Standard Life Aberdeen group, which contains two other platforms (greedy). Firstly, a large slice of assets on the platform sits within Standard Life Investments funds. Secondly, the group also owns the 1825 advice network, which mandates usage of the Standard Life Wrap. So, what of the success of SLW? Like Nucleus, it’s main revenue generator is core platform charges but there’s clearly a lot more at play in the wider context, including the Phoenix deal,  ner details of which may well have emerged by the time you read this.\nSkittling through the rest of this list and you’ll soon  nd that few platforms have the same set of comparators. Once you introduce the various other factors that de ne success for a platform, the water quickly gets muddy.\nWell, this is all very intellectually gratifying Steve but what are the practicalities?\nOK, sorry. Throughout the due diligence and platform selection exercises that we carry out for advisers, we stress two golden rules:\n• Understand your own priorities when assessing providers.\n• Ask meaningful questions.\nThat second one is particularly pertinent. We’ve joked about this in a previous edition but it’s worth repeating here. If you ask twenty platforms, “Are you committed to the UK market?” then what are you going to do with the inevitable binary results?\nInstead, when assessing platform performance from a  nancial perspective, we suggest looking at a series of data points:\n• Ownership structure\n• % of new business that platform\ncontributes to • Scale (AUA)\n• The  nancial strength, including pro t/ (loss), of the speci c platform business\n• If relevant - the  nancial strength, including pro t/(loss), of the group in which the platform sits\n• To what degree the platform either subsidises, or is subsidised by, other business units in its group\n• New business momentum (net sales  gures)\n• Capital adequacy\n• Yield on assets\n• Planned development spend\nWe  nd attributing your own level of importance to each aspect and rating the responses accordingly a useful exercise.\nThe strength or otherwise of the objective measures will naturally in uence the answer to the far more subjective issue of how well the business is doing and how committed to the market it’s going to be. And how well placed it is to keep investing and stay ahead, or at least in line with, what the market expects from a platform.\nAnd then it’s up to you to take that information and make an informed and balanced assessment.\nThat’s our view. We’d love to hear yours.\nVisit www.langcat nancial.co.uk for more from Steve and the rest of the lang cats.\n  ","  6\n  Volatility strikes back\n Vanguard Europe\nMarket volatility isn’t always synonymous with portfolio losses. A closer look shows why we shouldn’t expect a premium for holding equities without it. Here’s what we can do to manage our emotions when volatility takes centre stage.\nWhen volatility returned to global equity markets earlier this year, headlines cast this statistical concept in its familiar role as investors’ most fearsome enemy.\nBut volatility may be getting a bad rap. It’s not a villain, and it’s not always synonymous with portfolio losses.\nA closer look at the concept can help us understand what volatility is, why we shouldn’t expect a premium for holding equities without it, and what we can do to manage our emotions when volatility takes centre stage.\nVolatility is not directional\nA common misconception about volatility is that it implies direction and that, therefore, lower volatility is preferable to higher volatility. In reality, market volatility metrics are simply measures of dispersion around the average return, providing no insight into direction. A used automobile is an incredibly low-volatility asset in that it steadily declines\nin value over time; that doesn’t make it a good investment. In fact, outside of the mobility bene ts it provides its owner, it is the very de nition of a poor one.\nAn investment’s recent returns determine whether volatility marks a change for the better or the worse. In recent years, equity prices have marched steadily higher.\nTwo portfolios, identical volatility\nIn this situation, a few instances of negative returns will have a larger impact on volatility metrics than will positive returns of the same magnitude. By contrast, during a period of steady equity market declines, a few days\nof positive returns will produce a spike in volatility. The  gure below demonstrates how two different portfolios with opposite performances can produce identical volatility measurements.\n Notes: Figure shows hypothetical return simulations for two portfolios. Volatility is calculated as the 10-day rolling standard deviation of daily returns. Source: Vanguard.\n"," 7\n  Investors must remember that short-term volatility is the price for long-term outperformance. Historical data show that over long periods, investors are compensated for holding riskier assets with higher returns than those of less risky assets.\nAs you might expect, the longest continuous period of above-average market volatility1 since the Great Depression occurred during the 2008 global  nancial crisis. What you might not expect is that if you bought the S&P 500 Index at the peak of its volatility (21 November 2008) and held it until volatility fell back below its historical average nearly a year later (28 September 2009), you would have earned a 33% return, even before accounting for dividends. (Note: Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results.)\nIgnorance (toward volatility) is bliss\nInvestors must remember that short- term volatility is the price for long-term outperformance.\nHistorical data show that over long periods, investors are compensated for holding riskier assets with higher returns than those of less risky assets. Daily account balances may start demonstrating larger  uctuations than in recent years, but long-term investors must resist the urge to make impulsive changes\nto their investment plans. As Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman said, “If owning stocks is a long-term project for you, following their changes constantly is a very, very bad idea. It’s the worst possible thing you can do.”2 Mathematics explains why.\nAs mentioned above, stock market volatility explains how often and by how much equity returns differ from their average value. The mechanics of the calculation mean that while investment returns increase in proportion\nto time, volatility increases more slowly – in proportion to the square root of time.3\nThe upshot is that the less frequently you peek at your portfolio, the less likely you are to see a loss and, potentially, feel fear and regret. The table below demonstrates this phenomenon using daily S&P 500 Index returns. Notice how returns grow at a faster rate than standard deviation of returns, a.k.a. volatility, and that as time goes on, the likelihood of realising a positive return increases.\n Time horizon\n  Median return\n  Standard deviation of returns\n  Positive return probability\n   One day\n  0.06%\n  1.10%\n  54%\n   One week\n   0.35%\n   2.27%\n   58%\n   One month\n 1.29%\n 4.19%\n 64%\n   One year\n   13.69%\n   16.50%\n   83%\n   Ten years\n  119.01%\n  137.45%\n  91%\n   Sources: Vanguard calculations, using data from Bloomberg. Dates: 4 January 1988–16 February 2018.\nOnce again, this highlights the importance of a long-term focus when investing, as any single day offers just better than a 50% chance of positive returns. Investors who ignore short-term volatility and follow a disciplined investment plan will realise that when it comes to long-term returns, time is on their side.\n1 Volatility in this example is de ned as the rolling 30-day standard deviation of price returns for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, with the historical average taken from March 1928 through February 2018.\n2 Zweig, Jason. 2001. Do You Sabotage Yourself? Money (May 2001): 78\n3 The square-root-of-time rule is a useful, but not perfect, method for scaling volatility. Observed data differ from the model’s assumptions of normally distributed returns and zero mean value.\nInvestment risk information:\nPast performance is not a reliable indicator of future results. The value of investments, and the income from them, may fall or rise and investors may get back less than they invested.\nImportant information:\nThis document is directed at professional investors in the UK only, and should not be distributed to or relied upon by retail investors.

However, the results can often vary signi cantly depending on when you decide to start saving for your retirement and asset allocation decisions.\nHow much can a retired investor draw in income and yet not outlive their savings? This is the crucial question that aeronautical engineer turned  nancial adviser William “Bill” Bengen set out to solve in the early 1990s. Known as the 4% rule, Bengen argued that investors could safely withdraw 4% of their savings annually over 30 years without running out of money, adjusting for in ation1.\nThe 4% rule, often referred to as the Bengen rule, is now commonly used by retiring investors and their  nancial planners. Set, forget, and spend (if required). But is it as easy as all that?\nTiming is everything\nWhile it has not yet been 30 years since publication, we can run some ‘half-time’ analysis. Using Bengen’s original parameters, we assumed a static split between domestic equities and bonds.\nFigure 1 shows the change in the value of a portfolio over discrete 15-year periods for a UK investor if they were drawing down their portfolio by 4% per year. This assumes they\nFigure 1: Change in real value of wealth of 15 years assuming 4% drawdown (UK portfolio)\n Source: LGIM, UK portfolio calculations based on a portfolio split of 50% UK equities and 50% UK gilts\nare invested in a ‘naïve’ portfolio that is 50% invested in UK equities and 50% in gilts.\nFor the lucky retiree who began drawing down in 1993, their capital has gained 46% in real value by 2008. Begin saving a few years later in 1996 or 1997 and the capital has remained static or depreciated only a little. This level\nof remaining capital should be enough to support another 15 years of income.\nRetirees who start between 1998 and 2001 are instead much less fortunate. In the  rst half of their 30-year retirement journey, their portfolios have suffered a 30-41% capital loss. The dot-com bubble and the global  nancial crisis have damaged the fragile starting capital. Where a 4% drawdown seemed like penny-pinching for the 1993 intake, it now looks like an extravagance which the investor can ill afford.\n "," 9\n                                 Figure 2: Estimated monthly post-annuitisation payout after 15 years\nA dynamic withdrawal strategy, more closely linked to the amount of spending necessary per year rather than a  xed portfolio percentage, may signi cantly improve the investment outcomes. Investors and their  nancial advisers should constantly evaluate their portfolios to ensure the effectiveness of their chosen strategy.\n1 Determining withdrawal rates using historical data, William Bengen 2 Calculations based on £100,000 investment in a 50% UK equities, 50% UK gilts portfolio and contemporary annuity rates\nContact us\nFor further information about our Multi-Index fund range:\nCall:03450708684 Visit:lgim.com Email: fundsales@lgim.com\nImportant Notice\nThis is not a consumer advertisement.

The value of investments and any income from them can fall as well as rise, is not guaranteed and your clients may get back less than they invest. These Legal & General Multi-Index Funds may invest overseas. Changes in exchange rates between currencies may cause the value of an investment and the level of any income\nto rise or fall. These funds are sensitive to interest rate changes. An increase in medium to long-term interest rates is likely to reduce the value of an investment in these funds. The funds invest in riskier bonds, known as sub investment grade bonds. These bonds pay higher interest rates to try to provide more attractive income returns. To achieve this, greater risk is taken as the companies are more likely to miss payments or not repay the loan, resulting in the returns on your clients’ investment falling. *Call charges will vary\nand calls will be monitored and recorded.

Authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.\n  Source: LGIM, LGR\nDynamic, not dogmatic\nSo how serious is this for an investor? A 15-year real value decline of 41% is one\nthing on a portfolio statement, the effect it\nhas on the potential level of income is quite another. Imagine a 65 year-old retiree decides she wants to purchase an annuity at age 80, following a 15-year period of 4% drawdown.\nIf she started retirement in 1993, from 2008 onwards she could enjoy monthly payments\nof around £1900 for the rest of her life. However, if she were to invest from 2000- 2015, an annuity would only provide as little\nas £600 per month2. Investors need a more dynamic retirement income strategy - one that embraces the importance of diversi cation and adjusting the level of income depending on the client requirements.\nBengen’s starting point – an equal portfolio split between equities and bonds – is conservative and does not necessarily re ect the standard appetite for risk among retirees. At a speci ed risk level, spreading investments over different asset classes gives investors a better chance of preserving capital. In addition, understanding the risk appetite for the investor is the most important step for any adviser\nin both the accumulation and decumulation phases of investment.\nSuitability remains fundamental to the adviser process. Finding a fund range that can meet\na wide range of risk appetites is therefore extremely important. Finally, investors can\nin certain circumstances now pass on their pension pots to their children without incurring\ninheritance tax therefore portfolios that are income focused, but not income obsessed, may be more appropriate. Unlike yield-targeting funds, growing clients’ capital as part of a total return aim alongside generating a sensible\nyield can be better aligned to their needs. It\nis this total return focus that sets the L&G Multi-Index Income Fund range apart as we believe this helps to reduce the risk of the capital investment being depleted too quickly. Designed for advisers, they are a range of diversi ed funds at different risk levels, meeting the risk appetite of your clients whilst still providing a level of income commensurate with a core sustainable investment holding.\nThere is one  nal omission from Bengen’s original paper – fees. Whilst we cannot guarantee the direction of markets, what we can guarantee is that fees will detract from returns year after year, so it is important for any adviser to meet the objectives of investors in a cost-effective manner. Available to advisers for a fee of up to 0.4%, the L&G Multi-Index Income fund range is one of the most cost- effective solutions in the market.\nA  exible strategy is a prudent one\nEach investor’s situation differs along with their appetite for risk, their retirement spending goals or portfolio capital. Blindly following a 4% withdrawal strategy\nmay lead to particularly volatile results. Indeed, Bengen’s research did not suggest withdrawing this amount every year – just that it was safe to do so without running out of money.\n","  10\n Seeking to limit downside in times of market turbulence\n John Stopford | Head of Multi-Asset Income, Portfolio Manager\nJason Borbora | Assistant Portfolio Manager | Investec Diversi ed Income Fund\nThe Investec Diversi ed Income Fund is a defensive return solution which also aims to protect investors from the worst market falls.\nOnce again, during the latest period of market turbulence, the Fund has delivered on its aims for investors, as it has done since it was launched in September 2012.\n What the fund offers\n1 Defensivereturnfund: Aiming for attractive income with capital growth over the long term\n2 Attractive,sustainableyield: Targets 4-6% p.a.\ndistributed monthly*\n3 ‘Bond-like’volatility: Targets less than half the volatility of UK equities\nHow we do it\nA Resilientportfoliobuilt\nfrom the bottom up\nB Structurallydiversi ed and actively managed\nC Focus on limiting downside risks\n  *These internal parameters are subject to change not necessarily with prior noti cation to shareholders.

Also shown is the performance of income and defensive fund peer groups.\nDuring the VIX spike period at the beginning of February 2018, the Investec Diversi ed Income Fund returned -1.0% when the FTSE All Share Index declined -6.2% over the same time period; the Income and Defensive peer groups returned -3.2% and -2.1% respectively. This demonstrates the more defensive nature of the Investec Diversi ed Income Fund.\nGeneral risks The value of investments, and any income generated from them, can fall as well as rise. Where charges are taken from capital, this may constrain future growth. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results. Investment objectives and performance targets may not necessarily be achieved, losses may be made.\nSpeci c risks Currency exchange: Changes in the relative values of different currencies may adversely affect the value of investments and any related income. Default: There is a risk that the issuers of  xed income investments (e.g. bonds) may not be able to meet interest payments nor repay the money they have borrowed. The worse the credit quality of the issuer, the greater the risk of default and therefore investment loss. Derivative\n& Counterparty: The use of derivatives may increase overall risk by magnifying the effect of both gains and losses. A counterparty to a derivative transaction may fail to meet its obligations thereby leading to  nancial loss. Developing market: These markets carry a higher risk of  nancial loss than more developed markets as they may have less developed legal, political, economic or other systems. Interest rate: The value of  xed income investments (e.g. bonds) tends to decrease when interest rates and/or in ation rises. Equity investment: The value of equities (e.g. shares) and equity- related investments may vary according to company pro ts and future prospects as well as more general market factors. In the event of a company default (e.g. bankruptcy), the owners of their equity rank last in terms of any  nancial payment from that company. Government securities exposure: The portfolio may invest more than 35% of its assets in government securities issued or guaranteed by a permitted single state.\n  ","     12\n                      Time to invest?\n Simon Evan-Cook | Senior Investment Manager | Premier Asset Management\nSimon Evan-Cook, Senior Investment Manager at Premier Asset Management, considers the dilemma currently facing investors; whether to invest now, when equities aren’t obviously cheap, or to be patient and wait for a sell-off to make them so.\n When assessing likely future returns, the height or duration of a market rally are actually not that relevant. Valuations of the stocks within the market have historically proven to be a far better indicator. And,\nin general, these look fair at best for most markets, or expensive if you’re looking at\nthe US. “Fair” here means able to generate returns that are average by historic standards, so perhaps mid-single digit nominal returns: nothing spectacular, but still worth having.\nThat, however, tells us nothing about when the next sell-off will be. The timing of these are all but impossible to predict and are not dictated by the prevailing level of valuation.\nThe challenge currently facing investors is whether to invest now, when equities are\nnot obviously cheap, or to wait for a sell-off to make them so. The real problem is not knowing whether this valuation dilemma\nwill be short-lived (i.e. “acute”, in medical terms) or if it is here to stay (i.e. “chronic”). Unfortunately, in order to achieve the best outcome, the acute and chronic scenarios require radically different treatments. Clearly, it would be handy if we knew which it is before the fact. But sadly we do not. To make matters worse, taking the ‘acute’ course of action could be costly if the problem proves to be ‘chronic’ and vice versa. There is a lot\nat stake.\nI have therefore been considering the range of choices available to investors, and their potential outcomes, if they invested £100k\n- or not - for the next ten years. It occurred to me that, coincidentally, investors in 2007 were facing a similar conundrum. Markets had risen a long way, which left them feeling “toppy”, and valuations were best described as “fair”, if not expensive. Given that coincidence of timing, I thought it would be interesting to see how the decisions from my analysis would have turned out if they had been made back in the summer of 2007.\nThe results were surprising (in a good way). It turns out that the actual experience of 2007 to 2017 was eerily similar to the hypothetical 2017-2027 experience I had originally forecasted.\nJust as they were in 2017, markets were hitting new highs in summer 2007. This always gives cause for concern, but conditions otherwise felt fairly benign. Yes, we now know the  nancial crisis was beginning to kick off - the run on Northern\n When assessing likely future returns, the height\nor duration of a market rally are actually not that relevant. Valuations of the stocks within the market have historically proven to be a far better indicator.\n ","  13\n                        The challenge facing investors today is determining whether now is the right time to invest.\nRock happened in September 2007 - but that was not widely appreciated at the time.\nThen, as now, we had no idea whether the valuation dilemma was acute or chronic. The bene t of hindsight tells us that the situation was acute (i.e. short-lived) back in 2007,\nas the Global Financial Crisis provided the catalyst for a sell-off. Equities immediately tanked, then rebounded at a faster pace. Just 18 months later, the investors’ dilemma had disappeared. Valuations hit dirt-cheap levels. Well, it theoretically disappeared. Investors should have been  lling their boots with shares in the eye of the storm, but this is far easier said than done.\nWhile the numbers are different, I found that the actual outcomes over the initial ten-year period were very similar to those implied\nin the forward-looking analysis for the next ten. Cash underperformed CPI, meaning a real loss to anyone who had spent the whole period huddling in their savings account.\nThe UK stock market, meanwhile, produced very useful nominal and real returns, thereby rewarding anyone who was prepared to risk switching their cash for equities and then hold  rm. 18 months in though, this would have felt like terrible timing, as markets plumbed their crisis troughs. Sure enough, the worst outcome came from panic selling at that point, then remaining in cash. The best result came from the (highly improbable) feat of staying in cash from the stock market peak\nto trough, then bravely shovelling all of your wealth into the market at what felt like the heart of the crisis (the start of March 2009).\nBut to get back to my original point; investors who bought in the summer of 2007 still made respectable absolute and real returns over the following decade. This was in spite of buying at the worst point for several years (before\nor after) and having to sit through the most brutal  nancial crisis since 1929. The lesson? A long-term perspective is perhaps the most important weapon in any investor’s armoury.\nAt Premier, we assess the valuations of different assets and markets on a whole\nhost of measures, with a view to roughly estimating what they might produce over the medium to long term as opposed to guessing how politics and macroeconomic events will unfold in the short term.

The 14th century friar and scholastic philosopher said that “plurality must never be posited without necessity”. He gave precedence to simplicity, meaning that of two competing theories, the simpler explanation is to be preferred.\n Complex solutions to solve basic problems\nThe asset management industry aims to serve the best interests of investors who want to generate a return on their capital. We have a  duciary responsibility for our clients’ money and we take this role very seriously.\nHowever, the industry sometimes has a habit of building more and more complex solutions to solve the basic problem of how to generate a return, not always operating in the spirit of William of Ockham. Some of these complex products have been blamed for their contribution to the Global Financial Crisis, with the securitisation of sub-prime mortgages attracting particular attention over the following 10 years.\nThe impact of regulation\nSince the Financial Crisis, the UK has seen\na raft of new rules and regulations with\nthe aim of making  nancial markets more ef cient, resilient and, crucially, transparent.\nMost recently, MiFID II has considerably expanded the scope and spirit of the transparency requirements introduced by the Retail Distribution Review (RDR). Among other changes, clients must now be told, both pre- and post-sale, about any costs related to an investment. Advisers also have the challenge of meeting enhanced client reporting requirements under which clients must be updated on the performance of their investments, more frequently.\nAll of this must, somehow, be done while also offering clients your core service: quality advice.\nHow can multi-asset help?\nWhen appropriately constructed, multi-asset solutions are perfectly placed to deliver a transparent ‘all in one box’ solution to meet clients’ investment objectives, meaning an adviser can focus on clients’ life objectives.\nMulti-asset evolution – our survey\nThere is a myriad of multi-asset strategies on offer to advisers all with different approaches and views on how to generate returns. So through independent research by Citywire and The Wisdom Council, we asked both advisers and investors what they really want from a multi-asset fund.\n‘Value’ was the resounding theme. Yet ‘value’ is subjective, and goes much further than value for money.\nWith this in mind, we streamlined the asset classes in the portfolios and removed ones where the costs didn’t outweigh the bene t, such as hedge funds. We believe that assets used to ful l our portfolios should only be included if they can be fully understood, are suf ciently liquid, and effectively replicate the asset class in a cost ef cient way.\nInvesting, by de nition, is for the long term. Complex strategies may deliver in the short term, but we believe portfolios should be\n "," 15\n Effect of compounding charges\nu £100k invested u 7% growth rate u 30 year term\nOverall\n£700,000 £600,000 £500,000 £400,000 £300,000 £200,000 £100,000\nFund charge 135bps\n97,907\n35,807\nColumn1\nFund charge (23bps) Advisor fee (50pbs)\nClient\nFund charge 23bps\n    Fund charge (135bps) Advisor fee (50pbs)\nClient\n  £0\nSource: HSBC Global Asset Management\nColumn2\nThis graph is for illustrative purposes only.\n449,330\n20,268 43,994\n 616,994\n   HSBC Global Asset Management manages $469bn across six asset classes supported by 600 investment professionals across 26 countries.

In short, there is value in being boring.\nActive-active or passive-passive?\nWith the high proportion of returns being driven by asset allocation it is worth differentiating those that have a dynamic view of the various markets, making active asset allocation calls (ie. daily or weekly) from those that take more of a passive approach, believing in a static (typically annual) asset allocation decision.\nCoupling this with whether the underlying holdings are actively or passively managed, the choice for advisers has typically been to select either an active-active or passive- passive.\n0\nHerein lies the next phase of the multi-asset evolution. Active-passive.\nWe at HSBC Global Asset Management believe that in active asset allocation with passive ful lment, enabling advisers and clients to bene t from the key driver of performance at a fraction of the cost. And value for money is anything but boring! However, as always the value of investments may fall as well rise and investors may not receive the original amount invested.\nCost and compounding\nOver a hundred years ago Einstein referred to compound interest as the eighth wonder of the world. In 2018 this statement couldn’t be truer with clients at their most cost conscious and a regulatory framework championing transparency. The effect of costs on compound growth is shown in the following table and further reinforces why cost and value is at the heart of HSBC’s Global Strategy Portfolios.\nPUBLIC\nAs the modern William of Ockham may say: keep it simple, stupid.\nHSBC’s Global Strategy Portfolios cover  ve risk categories and start with an OCF of 17bps.\nwww.assetmanagement.hsbc.com/uk\n ","  16\n Introducing Smith & Williamson’s Managed Portfolio Service\n Mickey Morrissey | Head of distribution | Smith & Williamson\nSmith & Williamson has been advising private clients and their families since it was established in 1881 and now has around £20.4bn of funds under management and advice (as at 31 December 2017).\nIn September 2012 we launched the Managed Portfolio Service (MPS) for  nancial advisers and their clients, and designed it to include open ended funds, Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and investment companies, which provides the service with a point of difference in the market.\nWith  ve and a half years of performance track record and six models available, we\nare delighted to be working with Synaptic Risk which will give advisers access to our six Synaptic risk pro led models ranging from Defensive to Dynamic Growth.\nAs the outsourcing of investment management by advisers continues to increase, we are con dent that our range\nof six risk pro led models with a blend of investment companies, open ended funds and passive investments will be popular with  nancial advisers. I hope you  nd our article on the bene ts of segmentation for  nancial advisers interesting and enlightening.\nTaking a long-term approach: Finding a pro table alternative to dismissing ‘unpro table’ clients\nComplying with regulation and responding to other factors are continuing to have an impact on  nancial advisers’ operating costs. Some are therefore making radical changes to their businesses in an attempt to remain pro table.\nFaced with higher costs as they grapple\nwith regulation, one obvious temptation\nfor advisory  rms is to take a hard and\nfast look at their client books and speedily dismiss those who don’t meet minimum requirements. The bar is steadily rising in\nthis respect, with anecdotal evidence from across the market suggesting that even investors with portfolios of less than £70,000 or £100,000 – no small amount by any means – are being told to make alternative arrangements.\nSpecialisation is, of course, a perfectly acceptable and indeed sensible strategy for advisory  rms, but taking such an approach\ncould turn out to be short-sighted in the longer term if not considered carefully. Clients who may today seem low value on paper may in the future prove to be big fee earners as their  nancial planning needs become more complex.\nThe worry is that if advisory  rms give investors their marching orders now, they may unintentionally be providing referrals to their closest competitors or robo advisers which could prove lucrative in the longer term. If advisers dismiss those clients now, the earning potential from that individual may be lost forever.\nForward-thinking advisory  rms are increasingly discovering that segmentation provides a way for them to manage their resources effectively and ensure they remain pro table in both the short and long term.\nAs clients’ lives evolve and their ability and willingness to pay higher levels of fees change, then a  rm can alter the level of service provided accordingly.\n  "," 17\n  As the outsourcing of investment management by advisers continues to increase, we are con dent that our range of six risk pro led models with a blend of investment companies, open ended funds and passive investments will be popular with  nancial advisers.\nWhether an investment proposition is delivered in-house or is outsourced can make a considerable difference to the cost\nof providing a service to clients. Yes, there are merits in offering a bespoke investment service, but it requires a considerable amount of an adviser’s time when you consider all the research that needs to be undertaken\nto satisfy suitability requirements. And, given costs are on the rise for  rms, this is not necessarily viable if clients don’t have a sizeable amount to invest.\nIf advisory  rms effectively segment their client banks, intermediaries will  nd it is not dif cult to pro tably service many of their lower net worth clients through a managed portfolio service, accessed through an investment platform. For traditional balanced growth clients without any capital gains issues, outsourcing to an investment manager in this way could be ideal.\nBy using a managed portfolio service for lower net worth clients, intermediaries will have more time to spend with their higher net worth clients and those with more complex  nancial planning requirements.\nAdvisers can’t control the costs of regulation, but they are in charge of their own destinies when it comes to other elements of their business. How investment services are delivered can make the difference between an investor being pro table and unpro table, both now and in the future. Firms should make effective use of technology, adopt segmentation techniques and outsource where appropriate, but perhaps most importantly they must make sure they don’t lose forever the clients that will be important to their business in the years to come.\nwww.smithandwilliamson.com @SmithWilliamson\nSmith & Williamson model portfolios asset allocation\n Source: Smith & Williamson Investment Management and StatPro as at 31.12.17\n Smith & Williamson is an independently owned  nancial and professional services group.

The growing focus on costs has been inescapable because much of the demand for investment solutions is cost-constrained and passive has often been the answer.\nIn the recent bull market, tracker funds have inevitably performed well and have been\nseen as a one-size- ts-all. However, as the Financial Times recently observed, “Index trackers are no miracle remedy. They are more like antibiotics: valuable when deployed in moderation, but likely to do more harm than good should their use become too widespread”.\nPassive products do have an important\nrole to play particularly within longer-term investment portfolios where the impact of market volatility is less critical. However, in other circumstances, passive asset allocation may also create problems because decisions are made based on historic correlations between asset classes and past volatility.\nThe major criticism of active funds is that they are expensive and they can underperform against a benchmark, particularly in the recent bull market.

However, when costs are taken into account, tracker funds inevitably underperform their benchmark too, and when markets change unexpectedly, which they often do, it can be problematic.\nGenuine active management can respond to changing market conditions so, as we move into a more challenging part of the economic cycle, this becomes an important consideration.\nA good example is the investment process used by the new BMO Universal MAP range. It has three proven active components:\n• strategic asset allocation\n• manager selection\n• tactical asset allocation\nAs with all investments, it is important to note that the value of investments can go down as well as up.\nStrategic asset allocation\nThis is the main lever of the investment process and takes a long view of global markets. The top-down asset allocation process undertaken by our team combines\na quantitative process with a qualitative evaluation. The asset allocation has permitted ranges, which offers our experienced team the  exibility to re ect its market view and take a defensive position where it believes it is more appropriate. Unlike many asset allocation strategies, we review ours quarterly to enable more minor shifts in the approach, ensuring we keep within volatility levels and expected return targets. This investment philosophy is also used with our institutional products.\nManager selection\nUsing the foundation of asset classes from the strategic asset allocation the team screens strategies to select the best solution for\nthe fund in each category and selects the appropriate experienced managers. For this range, we use our best in-house managers, many of which have long track records of beating benchmarks and are responsible\nfor collectively managing £188 billion (as at 31.01.2018). The importance of experienced managers is most signi cant when markets are more unsettled.\nTactical asset allocation\nThe strategic allocation is reviewed quarterly, but as we have often seen, events can occur at any time in the cycle, so our Multi-Asset team, who manages the BMO Universal MAP range, evaluate the tactical asset allocation on a monthly basis. The team reviews:\n• asset class allocation between equities and bonds on a global basis\n• geographical allocations within equities\n• sub-asset class allocations within  xed\nincome\nIn a changing market place where cost is a major consideration, the need for new and innovative solutions has never been more important. Until now investors have faced a binary choice – low-cost or active. With the BMO universal MAP range, investors no longer have to choose; genuinely active multi-asset fund management is now accessible at a low cost.\nFor professional investors only\nViews and opinions have been arrived at by BMO Global Asset Management and should not be considered to be a recommendation or solicitation to buy or sell any products that may be mentioned.\n© 2018 BMO Global Asset Management.

However, economic indicators suggest the US economic cycle is entering its latter stages; we are wary that the economy may overheat, and of the implications for US monetary policy.\nOther major economies continue to expand and subdued in ationary pressures will allow policy to stay accommodative.

During mid-cycle expansions, labour markets strengthen but the economy still has spare capacity. This keeps in ation low and allows monetary policy to remain accommodative, which is ideal for risk assets. As economic expansions mature, labour markets tighten, growth moderates and in ationary pressures build. This forces central banks to reduce policy support, putting pressure on  xed income markets and causing rotation within equities.\nHow is this affecting our portfolios?\nDespite treasury yields having risen,\nwe still prefer equities to  xed income. Equity earnings growth remains robust, while  xed income markets face multiple headwinds, including removal of liquidity by major central banks, rising US interest rates and increasing government debt issuance. This preference\nis also supported by the large differential between the earnings yield on global equities (higher) and that of ten-year US treasuries (lower, despite their recent increase).\nWe have diversi ed our portfolio through exposure to alternative assets such as structured investments and hedge funds. These are able to provide uncorrelated returns when the correlation between equity and  xed income markets is high.\nNevertheless, sovereign bonds could bene t from safe-haven demand in the event of a market shock, which could be catalysed by a deceleration in growth, increase in in ation, or a global trade war. We continue to monitor developments with a view to changing our asset allocation if appropriate.\nWithin equities, we retain a preference for Japan, where corporate balance sheets are strong and declines in spare capacity are encouraging investment. The weak yen is supporting the export sector; this should continue as Japanese monetary policy\nremains accommodative amid subdued in ation. We are also positive on Asia, as China’s robust economy continues to outperform expectations, exceeding the government’s economic growth target.\nWe have exposure to the lower end of the equity capitalisation spectrum through global smaller companies funds. Smaller companies are often less well researched than their larger peers, which can provide opportunities for active managers. Given recent market performance and rising US interest rates, we have begun\nto shift some of our ‘growth’ exposure into ‘value’. Generally, growth stocks are longer- duration assets which are valued on their future expected cash  ows and are susceptible to increases in the discount rate, while value stocks often act more like bond proxies.\nIn sector terms, we are positive on various themes such as technology and  nancials. We make active investments in technology, where many companies are disrupting traditional industries and have potential to experience above-trend secular growth rates. Financials stocks, speci cally banks, bene t from rising interest rates, providing a hedge against accelerating in ation.\nWe are underweight the UK, which faces elevated political risk, despite recent positive developments regarding Brexit. Weak real wage growth is weighing on consumption, the major driver of domestic economic growth.\nSource: Brooks Macdonald\nWe continue to apply a balanced approach to portfolio construction, aiming to bene t from the accommodative economic environment, while protecting the portfolio in case the risks we have identi ed intensify.

It’s been dominating the headlines again recently, but Mr Trump has never stopped playing the pugnacious attack dog of the anti-trade movement. Could the latest developments indicate a worrying predisposition to bite the hand that feeds American consumerism?\n As other policies were prioritised last year, many investors convinced themselves that Mr Trump’s campaign-trail tirades against the perceived evils of trade were just for show and that he wouldn’t legislate for them.\nBut we saw three strands of evidence to the contrary, and now, following this year’s raft of tariffs – announced or threatened – and tweets about trade wars being “easy to win”, the risks are more obvious than ever.\nAs we write, we are not predicting this is the start of a global trade war. The tariffs aren’t going to be as indiscriminate as\nthey  rst looked, with some of America’s allies exempted. We’re also waiting for\nthe outcome of — and response to — an investigation into alleged Chinese violations of intellectual property rights. But we want to make our position clear: nobody wins a global trade war.\nSo why should we be wary of assuming Trump’s anti-trade tirades were just for show? First, trade still featured heavily in the speeches he gave at rallies, which were rarely televised. His website continues to post updates about what he is doing to combat its perceived ills. And that’s quite sensible politics because his base is very anti-trade. What’s more, only a third of Republican- leaning Americans thought free trade had helped their  nancial situation and only half of all Democrat-leaning Americans, according to a Pew Institute survey from 2017. Mr Trump is not constrained by his electorate.\nSecond, Mr Trump immediately made conspicuously anti-trade appointments when he took of ce. His Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross, and his Trade Representative, Robert Lighthizer, have dedicated most of their careers to lobbying for protectionist measures. Pro-trade moderates that had Mr Trump’s ear kept resigning or losing in uence.\nWe’re sorry to disappoint anyone looking for a more sensational story, but the steel and aluminium tariffs were not a hot-headed decision, they were calculated. Mr Ross has spent the last nine months investigating whether imports of steel and aluminium posed a threat to American national security. The national security arguments may sound like sophistry given that most imports come from America’s allies, but that was calculated too – it’s the only basis for enacting protectionism without contravening World Trade Organization rules.\nThird, the Trump administration has overseen myriad pieces of protectionist legislation too arcane to be reported in the national papers. According to the independent Global Trade Alert initiative, US policy has moved sharply in favour of domestic  rms: in the  rst half of 2017, US policy initiatives hit the commercial interests of G20 partners 26% more often than during the same period in 2016. At the\n "," 23\n  As well as being bad for consumers around the world, the prospect of a descent into a beggar-thy-neighbour global trade war is one of the biggest risks to investment returns over the next decade.\nsame time the number of trade-liberalising legislations fell 49%. The reference year was not unusual; Trump has just ramped up a growing protectionist trend.\nFor sure, exports are a more important source of income and wealth in many\nother countries (exports to the US are a particularly large part of activity in Mexico, Taiwan and Malaysia), and the US is likely to be less scathed by a global trade war in the short run. But that’s a relativist assessment that doesn’t help the US consumer.\nAs well as being bad for consumers around the world, the prospect of a descent into a beggar-thy-neighbour global trade war is one of the biggest risks to investment returns over the next decade.\nDiscontent with globalisation is widespread - we can see clearly in hindsight that it\nwas a key in uence in the Brexit vote and US presidential election — but we believe protectionism to be a very poor means of alleviating it.\nTaken at face value, protectionist tariffs provide a large, easy-to-quantify gain to a small but visible and vocal number of people. But they simultaneously deliver a small, hard-to-quantify loss for every member of\na large and silent majority. The aggregated impacts of those small losses invariably far\noutweigh the ostensible gains. Some real- world examples help illustrate this. Between 2009 and 2011, the US raised tariffs on imports of Chinese tyres from 4% to 39%, which President Obama claimed had saved over 1,000 workers from unemployment. But a detailed study by the independent and  ercely respected Peterson Institute\nfor International Economics suggested that they came at a very high cost — at least $1 million per job ‘saved’.\nAccording to the US government’s own General Accounting Of ce, protecting US sugar growers and re ners during the 1990s bene ted producers to the tune of $1bn, but cost consumers $1.9bn, or almost double. In the case of the ‘Trump tariffs’ on steel and aluminium, independent think tank The Trade Partnership has estimated that, taken at face value, the tariffs would add 33,464 jobs in the US metals industry, but cost 179,334 jobs throughout the rest of the economy — a net loss of 146,000 jobs.\nThe bene t of trade is perhaps most easily understood at an individual level. Despite some of our ‘River Cottage’ escapist fantasies, most of us do not produce even a fraction of what we consume. We specialise in a certain activity, earn some income and use it to buy the things others can produce more ef ciently.\nFree trade has undoubtedly accelerated the broader process of ‘creative destruction’ and the corollary is greater disruption to working lives. To secure the bene ts of trade for future generations, policies that soften the disruption and diffuse the more immediate spoils\nare badly needed. If they’re neglected, the nationalistic demagoguery of maverick, anti- establishment politicians could deliver shock results — to politicians and investors alike.\nImportant information:\nRathbone Investment Management Limited is authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority.

The suite consists of three funds which cater to investors’ varying objectives and appetite for risk.\nThe funds are designed to meet three long- term levels of volatility: 6% for Conservative, 9% for Balanced and 12% for Growth investors, or roughly 40%, 60% and 80% of global equity risk. That said, we do not target a constant level of volatility as this could result in us taking a short-term view and changing positioning at the wrong time. 2016 was a case in point. As negative market reactions to the UK referendum and US election caused an initial spike in volatility, this quickly dissipated. Markets were then left above where they were leading up to these events.\nSince their inception over three years ago, the retail share class (GBP) for the funds has generated net returns of 3.9% (Conservative), 5.7% (Balanced) and 7.4% (Growth) respectively2.\nWhat makes us different?\nFor over 20 years, our 135-strong team has been dedicated to providing multi-asset solutions for clients. We have built the Wealthbuilder portfolios to be resilient across a business cycle. By incorporating exposure to alternatives and active strategies, we\naim to be less reliant on the performance of equities. An integral risk-based framework helps us get a deeper understanding of key risk drivers when constructing our portfolios. We then reduce or hedge risks which we do not believe we will be suf ciently rewarded for and monitor these on a daily basis. Our team of experienced economists helps us to interpret macroeconomic data and position the portfolios for the prevailing stage of the business cycle.\nThe themes we’re watching\nWe continue to emphasise three macro themes for 2018. Global growth will continue to run above trend but the pace is likely to moderate from the brisk momentum seen in the middle of last year. We favour Emerging Market assets as we see growth momentum in these economies as accelerating and having more room to run. Monetary tightening in\nthe US may start to become a headwind to market returns and growth. In 2017, we saw\na hawkish policy surprise being undone as disappointing in ation data led to continued easing of  nancial conditions and a fall in bond yields. We have seen this starting to change as rising commodity prices and tight labour supply start to lift in ation. While we expect the continued expansion to lead equity markets to new peaks, we think the path will continue to have more potholes (short-term pull backs). This environment should favour a dynamic approach to allocation for equities, corporate credit and commodities.\nFOR FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES USE ONLY - NOT FOR USE AND/OR DISTRIBUTION TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC.\nPast performance does not guarantee future results, which may vary.

This then leads to how do we decide that one manager or process is better\nthan the next and where is the best place for an investor to park their money?\nIn order for me to answer these questions\nit is important to give some perspective on the industry. The Investment Association (IA) is the trade body that represents UK investment managers. Given the huge variety of funds available in the UK, the IA provides a framework which categorises over 3,500 funds into over 35 sectors, with each sector having a clear de nition setting out the criteria that funds must ful l. Sectors\nare organised between income and growth producing assets, further classi ed based on the asset type, region or speci c objectives. Each sector is governed by both a sector committee and independent monitoring company to ensure they comply with their sector de nition.\nThe sector groupings provide a starting point for our analytical work. Each sector will vary by size, including a combination of both active and passive funds. We use both quantitative and qualitative methods to understand and compare the funds comprising an individual sector. If we take the UK Equity Income sector for example, which currently comprises 87 funds, we will  nd that there are a number\nof approaches that managers take within\nthis grouping. Some managers have highly diversi ed portfolios, others have more concentrated portfolios, some seek dividend income from small and mid-cap companies while others rely on larger multinationals\nsuch as Royal Dutch Shell, HSBC, BP, GSK and Vodafone, which account for a high proportion of total dividends in the UK market. Some\nmanagers seek to invest in dividend growing companies while others will use derivative strategies to enhance their income generation. There are numerous ways to slice and dice the sector in addition to the traditional ‘growth’ and ‘value’ style orientations. This leads me back to the initial question of how do we decide one fund over the other?\nI recently read Superinvestors, by Matthew Partridge, which gives an informative account of some of the most well-known investors\nin  nance over the past two hundred years. He selects twenty of the most successful investors over this period and rates them based on four simple metrics – performance, longevity, in uence and ease of replication, before assigning an overall rating to each investor. From traders to stock pickers to venture capitalists, the author selects a group of investors across a variety of specialisms. He compares the likes of Warren Buffett, Benjamin Graham and George Soros to some familiar names in the fund management industry today, including Neil Woodford\nand Nick Train, using his qualitative rating metrics. The original founders of global investment  rms T.Rowe Price and Templeton Investments are included, while the ‘father\nof index investing’ Jack Bogle also appears on the list. The author provides a biography of each investor before outlining their respective investment philosophies, examples of their successful (and not so successful) strategies and an assessment on how the reader can learn from each individual story. The author\nconcludes that a variety of approaches have been successfully employed over the past two centuries. The key message, however,\nis that each investor has created their own ‘investment edge’, each with their own unique preferences for the types of investments they invest in.\nAt RSMR, we are similarly looking for managers and teams that have that ‘investment edge’ over their peers. This may come through specialist knowledge and experience, dedicated teams and resources, and differentiated styles and techniques. We build a collection of data on each fund over time and maintain ongoing dialogue with fund managers and teams to monitor any changes that take place. Therefore, we do not seek to determine that one manager or process is better than the next, but rather\nto identify managers and teams that have crafted a process which can demonstrate consistency in line with their investment objectives. With a highly diversi ed universe of rated funds across the IA sectors, we are then con dent that we can deliver a range of portfolios for investors according to their risk tolerance and preferences.\nFind out more about RSMR’s ratings, research and portfolios\n01535 656 555\nwww.rsmr.co.uk enquiries@rsmgroup.co.uk\n  ","  28\n  Disciplined diversi cation for decumulation\n Toby Vaughan | Fund Manager | Santander Asset Management\nThe advent of pensions’ freedoms means there is a great deal more choice in how pensions are invested. While it’s no longer a requirement to purchase an annuity upon retirement, little has changed in the ultimate goal: most pensioners are looking for a steady, monthly income that keeps pace with in ation and won’t run out.\n  With income yields at ultra-lows and investors facing increased longevity and in ation risks, we believe it’s paramount that pensioners are not unduly exposed to investment and liquidity risk through an overly concentrated approach.\nThese new freedoms mean some are now opting to drawdown on their pension pot, rather than investing in an annuity. As they enter this decumulation phase, pensioners are faced with many choices and many challenges: average lifespans are increasing so the pension pot needs to last longer, while traditional sources of income are delivering extremely low returns. Decisions made at the start of retirement, when people are most likely to hold substantial amounts in their pension pots, will be key in determining both the level of income generated in retirement and the length of time it will last.\nWhat’s required at the start of this critical phase is an overall investment strategy that delivers relatively low volatility to reduce the chances of large short-term losses through diversi cation and investment  exibility within disciplined volatility parameters.\nIn addition, it helps to target a minimum income level, regardless of prevailing market conditions, without sacri cing the potential for some capital growth. This way, income sustainability can be achieved, with one eye on the potential preservation of capital over a much longer time horizon.\nMulti-asset solution\nAt Santander Asset Management, our Atlas Income Portfolio works on the premise\nthat diversi cation is the key to delivering enhanced income yields. We believe the best way to achieve those yields over the longer term is by giving the Fund Manager Investment  exibility within controlled parameters. Combining an attractive income yield with capital growth and preservation potential, distributions are smoothed to help pensioners manage their  nances and are paid monthly.\n“The Santander Atlas Income fund has\nan attractive yield target of 4% and the managers aim to generate this from a wide variety of sources whilst remaining within pre-de ned volatility parameters,” says Stewart Smith, Investment Research Manager at Rayner Spencer Mills Research (RSMR).\n "," 29\n  It helps to target a minimum income level, regardless of prevailing market conditions, without sacri cing the potential for some capital growth. This way, income sustainability can be achieved, with one eye on the potential preservation of capital over a much longer time horizon.\nRather than using a single risk pro le, the Portfolio operates within speci c volatility parameters, targeting a risk range of 3 to5(onour1to10scale).AstheFund\nis not shackled to a benchmark asset allocation strategy, the Fund Manager has the investment  exibility to deliver a good level of income, regardless of the prevailing market conditions.\nDiversi ed approach\nWith income yields at ultra-lows and investors facing increased longevity and in ation risks, we believe it’s paramount that pensioners are not unduly exposed to investment and liquidity risk through an overly concentrated approach. Rather than targeting income from just a few high- yielding asset classes, the Fund follows a diversi ed approach, using a wide range of asset classes and investment approaches.\nFor added peace of mind, we’ve also put in place investment limits on asset classes. For example, we limit exposure to property at 10% and alternatives at 20%. Fixed interest and cash falls in the range of 25-85%, while equity exposure is at 15-65%. We also\nenhance income through the limited use\nof call options, where we use the premium received from selling the options to enhance the natural income.\n“The process is robust and disciplined and subject to rigorous monitoring and controls,” says Stewart.\nWe also recognise that fees are vitally important during the decumulation stage in particular, and so, as always, we strive to minimise costs. The Fund has an ongoing charge  gure (OCF) capped at 0.99% which includes an Annual Management Charge (AMC) of just 0.4% per year.\n“In addition to the yield target and volatility parameters, the Fund is also managed to a strong cost discipline,” adds Stewart.\n“Overall, the Atlas Income fund is a strong option for income seekers also looking for an element of risk targeting from a multi-asset fund. We are delighted to add this to our suite of RSMR rated funds,” says Stewart. Santander Atlas Income has a Recommended Rating from RSMR, and a 5 Diamond Rating from Defaqto.\nFind out more\nFor further information please contact Simon Durling, Investment Product Specialist, quoting this article, on 07714 143205, email simon.durling@santanderam.co.uk or visit www.santanderassetmanagement.co.uk.\nThe Santander Atlas Income portfolio is a sub-fund of Santander Managed Investments OEIC (Open Ended Investment Company), a non-UCITS retail scheme, authorised by the FCA (UK).\nOnly for use by investment professionals.

Making the case for Pension Consolidation\n  LV= Retirement Solutions\nVarious FCA reports over the past couple of years have highlighted clients in inappropriate pension schemes, incurring high investment and product charges, as well as having investment in inappropriate funds based on their current risk pro le and capacity for loss.\n What’s more, some schemes are now dormant or inactive, such as old GPPs, personal pensions and closed company schemes, as well as old stakeholder schemes with a 1% charge.\nStats show that, on average, someone has eleven jobs during their working career. This means that many people could conceivably end up with that many pension arrangements by the time they retire.\nGiven that statistic, it’s easy to see how likely and probable it is that over time your clients will have acquired several small pension pots, and how these pots might not be the best option for them to ful l their income and  nancial planning objectives in retirement. They may not know or understand what they’ve got, how much is in each pot and how to access their funds.\nWhy it’s important to consider Pension Consolidation\nIt therefore may make good sense for individuals to consider consolidating all the pension assets into a single plan – especially when you consider that the bene ts available through scheme, both pre and post retirement, may not be as  exible as those now available through Pension Freedom and Choice. For example, a scheme might only offer an annuity on retirement, with no access to Flexible Access Drawdown. It may also only offer a limited range of investment options. Death Bene ts should also be an important consideration, as should safeguarded bene ts – which should be taken into account before any decision is made to transfer.\nLooking through the ‘consolidation’ lens’\nand bringing multiple pensions into one, potentially more cost effective in terms of reduced pension and investment charges, can give your clients (and you as their adviser), a clearer view of all their retirement holdings,\nwhilst they are still accumulating pension assets, and then throughout the retirement income planning process.\nWhen it comes to retirement income, it’s no longer a binary choice between an annuity purchase or income drawdown. Consolidation gives clients the opportunity to take full advantage of the range of  exible product options available through Pension Freedom and Choice - when and how to access income, and be better positioned to manage the risks of running out of money in retirement.\nAlongside the various income options, consolidation also provides  exibility and choice when it comes to selecting investment options. Given that many people consolidating their pension assets could have over 20\nyears until they want to start taking bene ts, investment choice is crucial. Many clients could be in default funds incurring high charges and with a risk pro le totally unsuited to the clients’ attitude to risk and capacity for loss.\n"," 31\n  It’s easy to see how likely and probable it is that over time your clients will have acquired several small pension pots, and how these pots might not be the best option for the clients to ful l their income and  nancial planning objectives in retirement.\nLV= is well placed to help your clients and you\nThe case for pension consolidation is clear.\nThe process calls for a provider that can offer\na solution that is simple and easy to use, with enough  exibility to cater for different life stages, whilst providing growth for your client’s retirement funds.\nWhether your clients are contributing to\na pension now, or if and when they decide they’re ready to move into their retirement and want to start taking an income, we can help.\n4 great reasons to use LV=\n1.

In his new book, “Beyond the 4% rule”, Okusanya provides detailed analysis on “safe levels of withdrawal”, differing withdrawal strategies and the impact and importance of sequencing risk. Okusanya takes the various and complex strands of thinking that inform current “decumulation” planning and translates these into practical strategies that can positively bene t clients and the advice process that supports them.\nIt is now commonly accepted that modern  nancial planning, particularly for clients in retirement, involves an adviser essentially becoming a client’s “mentor”. This means they provide not only the structuring, in terms of product and investment strategy, but also act as a coach and offer invaluable guidance and reassurance throughout a client’s retirement. On this basis, it is now more important than\never that client and adviser alike understand the “rules of the game”, particularly if it is now more likely that a client’s DC pot will never annuitise, that clients will be living longer and that the sustainability of their fund and income over time is of paramount importance. To be clear, the complexity of investment and withdrawal strategies, as well as the impact of tax, means that there needs to be a clear strategy, ideally “formalised” into a document that is signed and acknowledged by the client (and perhaps their wider family) with the adviser. This begs the question of why go to these lengths? Well, let’s consider the following.\nWhat happens if your client starts to demonstrate clear symptoms of cognitive disability? The onset of dementia is always an upsetting and deeply emotive situation. However, what is the adviser’s position when it is clear that a client is increasingly unable to make clear decisions, or there are real doubts and concerns over a client’s ability to understand what is happening around, and to them. If a formalised document (in the guise of a Portfolio Withdrawal Statement)\nhas been drawn up and agreed at the very outset of a client’s retirement dealing with this potential situation, the adviser has a clear pathway in terms of the framing of future advice and dealing with a client’s wider family circle. Without doubt, advisers increasingly will be dealing more and more with Lasting Powers of Attorney for individuals in retirement, or perhaps working alongside an individual’s “living will” which lays out how the client would like their  nancial affairs\nto be handled in the event of their mental incapacity diminishing.\nAnother area where this approach, I believe, helps the advice process is mapping out withdrawal and expenditure patterns for clients when their underlying investment strategy does particularly well, or enters a period of poor returns. In periods of market weakness and volatility, clients will naturally become nervous and concerned that their pension savings will ultimately not be able to sustain their standard of living, and indeed will be run down to nothing. A structure that allows for this contingency and implementing a timely plan of action can be incredibly\n "," 33\n  It is now more important than ever that client and adviser alike understand the “rules of the game”, particularly if it is now more likely that a client’s DC pot will never annuitise, that clients will be living longer and that the sustainability of their fund and income over time is of paramount importance.\npowerful and comforting. For example,\nclear guidance that if a portfolio were to\nfall by X over a particular period would trigger an immediate review of a client’s level of withdrawal and expenditure. Equally, the opposite is also true. If the underlying retirement portfolio experiences a period of strong returns, how does this translate into income and expenditure? Cash ow analysis remains key to all of this.\nAs discussed at the beginning of this article, “decumulation” advice is becoming a discipline in itself. Dealing with the challenges of sequencing risk, longevity and the health challenges of people living longer, combined with sustainable withdrawal rates and income sustainability, means that retirement advice cannot be a “set and go” strategy.\nThe great work undertaken by practitioners and academics both in the UK and the US\nwill continue to evolve, improving existing good practice. It is clear that advisers have a great opportunity to develop their respective retirement propositions based on the research and new thinking being undertaken, which can only be a positive development for clients and advisers alike and the future of UK retirement planning.\nAbout LGT Vestra\nLGT Vestra is a UK-based partnership between LGT and the executive partners of\nLGT Vestra.

An adviser  rm which provides an integrated set of services from investment management to platform to  nancial advice, can both simplify and streamline processes, and use the consequent economies of scale for greater pro t for the business and lower prices for customers.\nBut can this really be true? Does it work\nin practice? Can it only work for restricted advisers? Are there wider opportunities for smaller adviser  rms? Is vertical integration a get rich quick scheme for the founders or can it offer great value for money?\nThe idea\nThere are relatively few ways in which product providers sell in the UK:\n• Direct to customers\n• Via  nancial advisers\n• Advisers with in-house manufacturing\n(investment, product, platform).\nThe latter integrated model should allow better alignment of interest and economies of scale to be delivered to customers.\nThe evidence\nIn theory, the ability for adviser  rms to grow assets and use their simpli ed and streamlined processes to reduce costs is compelling. But\nthis theory may well be tested as part of the FCA’s Platforms Market Study – surely with platform assets approaching £600bn there should already be some customer bene t from reduced fund costs? Though adviser- facing platforms will argue that they don’t control which funds are bought and sold, so cannot have any in uence of the price that asset managers sell their funds for. Vertically integrated  rms may face tougher questions.\nDoes it work?\nOther networks/consolidators are still in\nthe early growth stage. They have growing scale but little evidence of costs falling yet. And while they have many of the elements\nin place to drive integration (DFM, platform permissions, adviser scale), it is too early to identify the outcomes for shareholders. Cynics will take the view that these “aggregators” are just in it for what they can get out of it – grow scale, create internal synergies and quick exit – with little customer bene t.\nIssues\nThe FCA will shortly require Authorised Fund Managers (AFMs) to disclose their Value for Money. This assessment will revolve around some key metrics:\n• Quality of service\n• Performance\n• Costs\n• Economies of scale\n• How the funds compare to others in\nthe market.\nThere is little doubt that St. James’s Place Wealth Management (SJP) has been successful for the business owners, it has grown assets rapidly and has a fast-growing adviser network – but has it worked for customers? There is little evidence that costs paid by customers have reduced, though the customer service ratings remain high. The new FCA “Value for Money” requirement may well tease out greater visibility of any ef ciency issues.\n "," 35\n  There is little evidence that costs paid by customers have reduced, though the customer service ratings remain high. The new FCA “Value for Money” requirement may well tease out greater visibility of any ef ciency issues.\nThese would seem good metrics to be able to assess whether Vertical Integrators (who are themselves AFMs) are delivering good outcomes – current evidence of the cost and economies of scale metrics would seem to suggest they are yet to add value.\nWhat is a fair price?\nBased on the most recent Barclays Equity Gilt study (2018) the long run annual return (over 50 years) for UK Equities was 5.6% and for Gilts 3.1% (after in ation).\nFor simple balanced fund of 60% Equity and 40% Gilts this would lead to a return of (before costs) of 4.6%pa.\nReal investment returns by asset class (UK) (%pa).\nSource: Barclays Equity Gilt Study 2018\nIt would not seem unreasonable therefore, that the total costs (advice, platform, fund management etc.) “spent” in the pursuit\nof this return should be less than 1.84%pa. Otherwise the customer (who ultimately supplies the investment capital) is rewarded with less than 60% of the total market return. That would surely be a poor outcome?\nI will leave readers to judge whether the costs incurred by customers of the Vertically Integrated  rms represent good outcomes.\nThe value chain\nThe elements available to be integrated would typically include:\n1.

Streamingtheadviceprocessacrossmany advisers should allow reduced compliance cost and better value to customers – but the immediate issue is the “shoe-horning” of customers into in-house products.\n2. Buildinganin-houseDFMand/orACD would allow the award of segregated mandates to asset managers. But there is little evidence so far that this has reduced consumer cost (even though some mandates are well over £1bn).\n3. Whitelabelplatformsareavailable\n– usually with the Integrator gaining platform permissions – but the evidence so far is that there is little, if any, cost saving to end customers under these arrangements.\n4. Thegovernanceandoversightofmandates should deliver good outcomes – but\nthe addition of DFM costs and charges/ the speed with which mandates can\nbe changed could be argued to be less bene cial – and the use of internal funds seen as a con ict.\nCon icts and management stretch\nPerhaps the biggest issue facing  rms looking to operate a Vertically Integrated business are managing the whole supply chain and the associated con icts of interest.\nRecent events suggest that just managing platform suppliers/change programmes is challenging enough. Add to this the fund management outsourcing (including an ACD/ AFM) and possible discretionary permissions. Plus, the CRM and wider IT complications. And the compliance/oversight/integration and management of a possibly broad-based adviser team, and the management scope becomes substantial.\nManaging this diverse operation, the potential con icts of interest, cross- subsidy issues while growing pro t, and\ndelivering economies of scale leave many commentators extremely sceptical (polite version) of this business model.\nSmaller  rms\nFuture\nThe ability of banks to use their customer data integrated with other information (under the new Payment Services Directive (PSD2) rules to suggest better products and services may see the gentle rebirth of bancassurance. No reason why advisers should not take advantage of these too!\nThe FCA is clearly pursuing a wider “Value for Money” agenda – and this spans advice, asset management and platforms – any new Vertical Integrator should face some serious scrutiny to make sure good outcomes are at the heart of the business.\nThe more onerous MiFIDII cost disclosures and the requirement to have an independent director on all AFM boards may also make any future business case harder.\nBut the existence of very low-cost passive funds, new platform entrants (that will white label for adviser  rms) and lower cost DFMs that offer truly bespoke and “whole of market” models for adviser  rms, with discounts for scale, may see the emergence of many smaller vertically integrated adviser businesses. And they will be both more pro table and offer better value for money than the  rst generation.\nFor more information about model portfolios designed for adviser  rms please drop me a line. David A Norman aka DAN david.norman@tc nvestment.com\nIs the opportunity for vertical integration only available for larger  rms, or can smaller  rms and their customer bene t? My  rm has seen growing interest in bespoke adviser model portfolios. By offering a whole of market approach aligned to the adviser risk tool output we can meet the needs of the bulk, but not all, of the advisers’ customers. The adviser can secure platform discounts that are passed directly to the customer. We have agreed an upfront discount to investment fees (underwritten by the adviser), again passed directly to the customer. All-in fees (advice, platform, tax wrapper, DFM, VAT and underlying funds) of 1.4%pa are achievable.\nThere clearly needs to be robust governance and oversight but this model works for all parties.\n ","  37\n                                   The Suitability Suite\nRisk .

The  rst was a certain punk band crashing onto the scene in 1976, resulting in the music that in uenced me during my informative years, and the sounds I still listen to as enthusiastically today.\n Another is BREXIT. Something which\nis having an impact on pretty much everything in our lives right now. There is\none myth, however, that needs to be dispelled. I’m sorry to break it to you but the GDPR has still gone ahead, whether we’re going to be in the EU or not, and it has done so with gusto.\nThere are probably many GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) programme managers wishing they could have downed tools once the ‘leave’ vote had been announced but alas, this myth, which did the rounds early in the BREXIT debate, is exactly that – a myth. Don’t worry, this article is not about BREXIT and unfortunately for me, not about modern pop culture either, but it’s about how the impact\nof GDPR is as signi cant to Synaptic Software and  nancial services, as the arrival of a certain punk band was to me back in the 70s.\nWe know the GDPR will primarily protect the personal data of all people living in the EU. Tick.\nHowever, it actually extends beyond the EU. It will also regulate the gathering and processing of personal data, regardless of where that takes place, as the Data Protection Act did previously. If you knew that, you’ll also be acutely aware of the potential  nes that can be imposed if  rms don’t comply – the worst case scenario being somewhere between £17 million or 4% of a company’s global annual revenue. But, we’ve been reassured that\n nes are intended as a last resort and the \[ICO’s\] focus and commitment is on guiding, advising and educating organisations on how to comply. Great for the headline makers, but, worry not, that is where the scaremongering ends, unless of course  agrant breaches are identi ed, and in which case, action will be taken with the potential for heavy  nes to be imposed.\nSo, what exactly have Synaptic Product Managers been doing to ensure their systems remain compliant with the new data privacy laws?\nSeb Marshall, Synaptic Suite Product Manager tells us how Synaptic’s ‘single point of entry’ one-stop shop for all matters risk and investment-related, has adapted to the GDPR;\n• Terms and Conditions (T&Cs) have been updated to account for all new GDPR regulations and are now accessible directly from the Help menu.\n• Improved deletion capabilities have been installed throughout the Suite. When deleting users and/or organisations additional functionality now exists to move clients and investment structures.\n• The Synaptic Suite now includes compliance for individual’s rights under the legislation such as PII data exports and the right to be ‘forgotten’.\n ","     39\n                                GDPR will primarily protect the personal data of all people living in the EU.

MiFID is increasing the proof that is required on suitability, and as part of an ‘ex-ante’ and ‘ex-post’ approach is putting a far greater responsibility on advisers if they wish to continue to earn ‘on-going’ income. We deal with the challenges of risk and suitability in a separate article further on, but here we are interested in exploring the role of cash ow modelling.\n A well-known ex-regulator is warning people that this is an area likely to attract regulatory oversight in the near future, given the context that it is almost impossible to provide easy-to-understand retirement advice without some kind of cash ow illustration. He also warns against trying to adopt too complex a modelling tool, as the increasing sophistication presents additional due diligence challenges, especially around more detailed tax treatment, and scope for errors increases. It is much more important to get key inputs right, including cost and growth assumptions. Small variations can lead to dramatically different results when the long terms used in these illustrations are taken into account.\nUsers of Synaptic research tools have an advantage in as much as they have access to the Moody’s stochastic engine and the Synaptic Comparator illustration engine, meaning that their inputs and analysis on growth and drawdown trajectories are\nsecond-to-none. Synaptic Modeller will allow you to project growth for a holding for up\nto 70 years (though we wouldn’t advise it!). You can also overlay any drawdown pro le and return a probability distribution graph indicating the likely success of the strategy, on a real (in ation adjusted) basis, whilst setting your retirement date and longevity assumption.\nLet’s look at a scenario: a saver (my age!) retiring at 65 in 2034, and living ‘til 95, looking to withdraw £2,000 a month (in ation adjusted), invested in a Standard Life SIPP, with in ation and costs factored in. The following graph is the stochastic projection from Modeller, and I can see\nthat I have about 45% chance of lasting the distance using my Balanced strategy (I need to increase my risk budget).\n","     41\n                              It is much more important to get key inputs right, including cost and growth assumptions.

Synaptic Analyser offers two key differentiating features. One is the ability to get accurate drawdown quotes from a range of providers, the second is to obtain accurate (enhanced) annuity quotes.\nSynaptic Analyser has been designed to offer simple illustrations relating to a drawdown product (you can set a simple income requirement using a slider if you want), or you can build the full retirement plan with multiple incomings and outgoings. The tool will apply tax and in ation adjustments as required.

Solutions packaged and institutionally managed by providers provided automatic cover for risk, unlike in today’s open architecture world. Things seemed more straight forward then, and volatility felt like an acceptable proxy for risk. ‘Vol’ could be broadly relied on to rank asset classes and therefore investments to produce a Markovitzian ef cient frontier. So, what changed? The FCA handbook now speci cally states that volatility cannot be used as a sole proxy for risk.\nFive years ago, the word ‘stochastic’ was a bit of joke to many advisers and commentators alike. But you don’t see the same kind of dismissive articles written now, referring to ‘roulette wheels’ and ‘pseudo-science’. Articles regularly joked at the absurdity of relying on a questionnaire in helping to assess the ‘unique’ circumstances and therefore advice relating to individual clients. You don’t hear this so often now, as an appreciation of the real grounding in demographic research and mathematical modelling has grown. It’s not true that you will get a different outcome every time you use the questionnaire, as detractors used to regularly claim. It’s true that you can’t predict the outcome of a toss of a coin, but do it 10,000 times or more and you can be certain. Some of this certainty can be harnessed in the best asset class return models that use mathematical simulation, such as the Moody’s Analytical model found in Synaptic.\nThis has a proven track record over decades.\nThe bene ts of working with psychometric questionnaires and probability-based models are becoming more and more self-evident. It was only a few short years ago that the star managers ruled the investment  rmament, but they do not carry the sway that they once did, as the age of information has levelled the investment playing  eld to such a degree. It\nis asset allocation that drives investment and reliable returns more than ever.\nIt’s always worth going back to the source to remind ourselves of the core of compliant advice and suitability. FCA COBS 9.2: (1), where\n“A  rm must take reasonable steps to ensure that a personal recommendation, or a decision to trade, is suitable for its client.”\nIt goes on to stipulate that said personal recommendation must\n When things take a turn for the worse, the ability for customers to appeal for redress on the basis that they were ill-judged for risk will be devastating for some advisers.\n "," 43\n                              1. (a) meets his investment objectives;\n2. (b) is such that he is able  nancially to bear any related investment risks consistent with his investment objectives;”\nMuch of the thematic work that the FCA has undertaken has lamented the lack of research and due diligence to support these two stipulations. The quality of outcomes has not been an issue, but we have of course had a brilliant environment for investment since the downturn of a decade ago. When things take a turn for the worse, the ability for customers to appeal for redress on the basis that they were ill-judged for risk will be devastating for some advisers, unless they embrace the best of the latest research-based risk management. The regulator de nes the ability to bear loss as whether it materially impacts their standard of living, and is enshrined in the concept of ‘Capacity for Loss’\nThe hardest thing seems to be the inability for some advisers to separate the Risk Pro le (which is concerned with the emotional relationship between Risk, Reward and Loss) and what may be an appropriate risk category for an investment objective.\nTo our knowledge, many advisers attempt to marry the Risk Pro le of the customer with all the recommendations they may offer. This is wrong, as risk is therefore not aligned to objectives. A simple way of underlining this truth is to remind ourselves that a customer has a single risk pro le (that may or may not change over time). They may, however, have several elements to their  nancial plan which are managed at different risk pro les to their Attitude to Risk pro le and are different to each other. Consider the Balanced investor who has their main pension savings in an Aggressive strategy and their ISAs invested Cautiously. Perfectly sound. They may be young, saving for their house deposit in the short-term through their ISAs, and several decades away from retirement.\nThe majority of income for advisers is\npension related, so getting accurate growth assumptions and predicting losses correctly has to be better than ‘robust’. Our knowledge of sustainable income in retirement, strategies for investment to accommodate longevity and lengthening retirement are proving\ntime and again the importance of getting\nthe maths right, and this can only work\nusing reliable mathematical models such as\nMoody’s Analytics. The need to monitor in order to adapt plans as necessary means that the old-fashioned advice by numbers and culture of ‘set and forget’ is redundant.\nThe modern adviser must have auditable processes in place for all of the above, and this is easy if you adopt a comprehensive approach such as the Synaptic Risk proposition, built around the Moody’s Analytics stochastic model, to which, uniquely, full access is given using the Synaptic Modeller tool. This means that you, as an adviser, can measure the ‘Value at Risk’ in a portfolio or fund, and make credible and reliable projections for growth using the model. There is no other way of capturing the full range of possible outcomes of a given investment. With Synaptic you can access the ATRQ, the investment strategy built by Moody’s and Risk Ratings for many\nof the leading investments for free. This is an easy way to help demonstrate your expertise, improve your compliance and protect your Achilles heel.\nCall us on 0800 783 4477 or visit www.synaptic.co.uk/research-tools/ synaptic-risk/register to set up your free client log on.\n  Our illustration compares our baseline strategy (Adventurous) to an investment recommendation. Using a term of ten years in this case, we can plot the probability attributable to different outcomes. The ‘Minimum gain’ clearly states the % loss my client can expect in a bad year (de ned as 1 in 20, that is to say 5% of the worst outcomes from the model). ‘Capacity for Loss’ can be clearly put in context (and accommodated).\n","

portfolios were constructed with longer investment timelines (15 year) in mind. Otherwise Synaptic Risk Ratings assume a 10 year investment horizon. You should consult Royal London directly for further information before recommending.\nAbout the service: Synaptic Risk Ratings are worked out by analysing the underlying asset classes within the fund or portfolio. Synaptic Software have requested asset allocation information from participating providers in a specific format aligned to the risk framework of the system. These asset classes are used by the model to determine the risk rating, a process that may result in a level of approximation though in most cases this will be insignificant. It is also possible that certain asset classes may not be represented exactly in the manner that providers would prefer.\nReasonable endeavours are made to provide accuracy and consistency, however neither participating providers nor Synaptic Software can be held responsible for any errors or omissions. No recommendation should be made solely on the basis of the Synaptic Risk Ratings, and additional research should be undertaken for any case. This service is intended for use by investment professionals only.\n","      GSAM.com\n                   GOLDMAN SACHS WEALTHBUILDER MULTI-ASSET PORTFOLIOS\nDefine your goals.\nWe’ll do the rest.\n                 Over three years, the Goldman Sachs Wealthbuilder Multi-Asset Portfolios have been committed to meeting investors’ distinct objectives through a diversified and dynamic multi-asset solution.\nWe understand that investors have different goals when it comes to investing their money.
