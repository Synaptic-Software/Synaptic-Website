What separates Munnypot from the rest is the fact that the founders were successful IFAs and retail investment specialists in previous lives – having built the Cavanagh business.\nI feel Bugattis offer an appropriate analogy to underline the progress that advisers have made in the 10 years that Connection Magazine\nhas been dropping into the consciousness of advisers. (Yes! It’s been that long).\nThe big themes we have covered (in retrospect) include the advent of platforms, RDR and now MiFID. What seems obvious to me is the extent to which advice is becoming a profession, and the way regulation is\nbeing used to demand more and more of advisers, which though irritating (obviously) has rendered the profession unrecognisable from its forebears. It’s just a shame that good advisers are still picking up the bill for bad advisers. The opportunities offered by the pension freedoms and retirees piling into\nthe retirement market are awe inspiring, and it is right that with so much at stake, the research and expertise that underpins the recommendations made is top drawer.\nIt is my privilege to work with some of Synaptic’s larger customer groups, who have been consulting on our forthcoming plans. We are re-designing the Synaptic solution to overcome the two great challenges posed by MiFID II:\n• The ability to fully update records in a customer’s CRM so that they can be routinely accessed at review;\n• The ability to build and maintain a C.I.P.\nOur recent launch of 1-10 investment strategy with A2R and Moody’s Analytics\nis the  rst of a raft of improvements and innovations that is designed to promote Synaptic way above the competition.

Despite huge differences in price, status and exciting optional extras, they are all manufactured by Volkswagen.\nRegardless of the broad availability of modest, personalised cars, the very wealthiest in society continue, and will continue, to buy supercars. In fact, over the past 50 years the majority of car manufacturers have diversi ed to cater to all budgets.\nToday you can pick up a Volkswagen Polo for less than £15,000* or a Bugatti Chiron for over £2.5m**. But, crucially, both are produced by Volkswagen.\n70% of revenue from the mass market\nOffering both enables Volkswagen to access the entire market. They can sell high end, luxury cars, with  ne Italian leather upholstery, starlight headlining, and carbon ceramic brakes to those who want them, at the same time as selling simple, safe and affordable cars to those who need them.\nIn fact, if Volkswagen had only sold Bentleys and Porsches last year it would only have made 10% of its annual revenue (see Figure 1). Despite the huge difference\nFigure 1: Volkswagen Group Annual Report 2017: key  gures by brand***\n in price between its top end and mass market cars, over 70% of Volkswagen Group’s 2017 revenue came from the sale of Volkswagen passenger cars, SKODAs, SEATs and Audis.\nThe same is true for  nancial advice\nToday, IFAs are servicing just 11% of the UK market (see Figure 2). Financial advice is generally the prerogative of the very\nwealthy. The cost of providing face-to- face  nancial advice, with full behavioural coaching and access to the full range of assets, is high. This inevitably restricts your potential client base.\nResearch by Deloitte shows that less than 25% of the UK obtain any kind of professional advice at all when choosing where to invest their money (see Figure 2). Or in other words, over 75% of the UK does not.\n  "," 5\n  Today, IFAs are servicing just 11% of the market.\nAccess the majority of your 2020 revenue with Munnypot.\nThe missing market: how to access the majority of your 2020 revenue\nWith increasing regulatory burdens and decreasing margins, this number could fall further. Technology can help. By automating various stages of the process, advisers can segment the  nancial advice market and access a previously untapped customer base at least 3x the size of the current pool.\nWith a digital investment advice platform like Munnypot, IFAs can service three distinct market segments with three distinct products:\n1. veryhighnetworthindividualswithface- to-face advice;\n2. future pipeline clients with hybrid advice led by a customer adviser;\n3. nextgenerationclientsandthemass market with a fully digital, online platform.\nThe Bentley of  nancial advice\nThe wealthy will always want face-to-face  nancial advice from their trusted  nancial adviser. Complex circumstances demand an in-depth knowledge of tax law, asset allocation and behavioural  nance, which\nonly an investment adviser can bring to the table. But by segmenting the market, advisers can spend more time focussing on the demands of their most pro table clients.\nAn income generating pipeline\nThrough a hybrid advice offering, IFAs have early and ongoing contact with a very wide base of customers. This provides access to a huge collection of data on future high net worth individuals. Using this contact, IFAs can know when to reach out to clients who have accumulated suf cient wealth to require more bespoke advice, proactively offering them an upgrade from the Passat to the Porsche (excellent performance as standard but bespoke build for extra).\nA hybrid solution enables customer service agents to provide clear and consistent  nancial advice using the straightforward direction of the Munnypot platform. Use of agents instead of advisers decreases\nthe time and cost required to service each client and use of the platform ensures any compliance risk is kept to a minimum.\nWe estimate the marginal cost of providing hybrid  nancial advice is just £100 compared to face-to-face advice costs of over £500.\nEnd to end automation for accessibility\nFor next generation clients and the mass market, IFAs can offer a fully digital robo-advice solution via their website. We believe our award-winning, simple, online user interface appeals to the next generation of millionaire investors.\nFull end-to-end automation results in very low marginal costs to servicing online clients and no ceiling on capacity. In fact, we estimate the marginal cost of providing automated advice is less than £5 per customer.\nMoreover, making  nancial advice accessible and affordable demonstrates\nto the younger generation the invaluable nature of obtaining appropriate investment advice throughout your life. Once a customer has received some form of advice and understood the huge value of it, we believe they are unlikely to go it alone.\n Digital advice does not undermine the immense value of  nancial advice. It demonstrates and democratises it. Munnypot enables IFAs to focus\ntheir time and attention on their most pro table clients, while simultaneously appealing to new generations, as well as building up a pipeline of new pro table business, without any effort at all.\nFigure 2: Usage of advice on product purchases among GB adults, 2014-2016****\n *Source: whatcar.com (https://www.whatcar.com/volkswagen/polo/hatchback/review/n83)\n**Source: whatcar.com (https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bugatti/chiron)\n***Source: https://www.volkswagenag.com/presence/investorrelation/publications/annual-reports/2018/volkswagen/en/Y_2017_e.pdf\n****Source: Deloitte, The future of automated  nancial advice in the UK (https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/lu/Documents/ nancial-services/lu-future-automated- nancial-advice-uk-15052017.pdf)\nFor more information on Munnypot or to arrange a demo, please email andrew.fay@munnypot.com or contact our of ces on 01293 224 281.\nImportant Information\nMunnypot is a trading name of Munnypot Limited which is an Appointed Representative of Resolution Compliance Limited which is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.\nFRN 574048.\n ","  6\n The informed consumer\n  Mickey Morrissey | Head of Distribution | Smith & Williamson\nIn many ways, the babyboomer generation makes for model clients. Members of this group are wealthy, committed to the idea of saving and investing and, importantly, trust those who advise them and act on their advice.\nBut this deference is disappearing with every generation. The next generation are well- informed, tech savvy, but less trusting of authority. For future generations, it may not be enough to hand their money back after 30 years of accumulation, even if the adviser has done a great job.\nPartly, this is a function of technology. These generations have access to real-time data on their bank accounts that they can access through their smart phones. They\nare used to moving money while drinking their coffee in Costa. Their understanding\nof  nancial platforms and products has never been greater. This is not a generation likely to be satis ed with an indigestible quarterly statement from a life company. They also expect advisers to adapt and make technology work for them.\nMany advisers may justi ably ask why they would need to concern themselves with these, trickier, future generations. Pension freedoms have given them a rich client base of those aged 55+, in need of good long-term advice on drawdown and inheritance tax planning. For most advisers, this will see out their careers. These future generations don’t\nhave the same level of wealth. Why try to adapt to their needs and preferences when there appears to be little short-term bene t?\nIt depends on the business an adviser wants to build. There will be those who simply want to wind down their client base ahead of retirement. However, for those who want to embed longer-term value, create\na business attractive enough to be sold on\nor even help existing clients manage their succession challenges, getting to grips with the preferences of an informed consumer will be crucial.\nIt is not all ‘stick’, there is also signi cant ‘carrot’ in the transfer of wealth between generations. Around $4tn is expected to be passed down from boomers to millennials within a generation in the UK and North America, according to research by the Royal Bank of Canada*. Helping clients manage this transfer and sustaining advice into the next generation represents a huge opportunity.\nIf your business isn’t doing it, Amazon or Revolut may well spot their chance.\nThe solutions to managing these clients exist already. The next generation is well-versed\nin using platforms. We have seen forward- thinking advisers put solutions in place to keep the next generation of clients ‘warm’ at a time before they have much need of  nancial advice. We have seen advisers put the sons and daughters of their wealthy clients in an appropriate portfolio from a model portfolio service, charging a small  at fee for an annual update. In this way, they are an established, trusted provider when those children inherit their parents’ wealth. As long as it is on a platform, advisers can point to it as a future source of growth and revenue with potential buyers. In this way, it embeds value in their business.\nTo our mind, the right model portfolio service is crucial to support this type of approach. If investors simply see a lot of funds they could have picked themselves, or they can get through a robo platform, the value looks limited. The client experience will also be vital. Robos do not necessarily offer lower fees, or a better investment portfolio, but some win out on simplicity and a lack of jargon.\nThe next generation will be tougher for advisers, but they will need advice and they\n* https://www.ft.com/content/aa704cbc-c9dd-11e7-ab18-7a9fb7d6163e\n "," 7\n  We have seen forward-thinking advisers put solutions in place to keep the next generation of clients ‘warm’ at a time before they have much need of  nancial advice.\nwill inherit wealth. Solutions already exist to allow advisers to steal a march on the tech giants who might otherwise eat their lunch.

Recently I’ve been spending the majority of\nmy time thinking about how advisers are putting together their\ninvestment propositions on platforms. Actually, scratch that. Treat\nanyone who starts an article with a sentence like that with the\nsuspicion it deserves.\nIn truth, I’ve been spending my time thinking about many things including, but not exclusively, when my impending mid-life crisis might kick in, whether Andy Murray will ever get back to his best, where to go on holiday next year and why I can’t start an article like a normal person?\nHowever, in the context of what is appropriate to share in an article for the  nancial advice profession, oh let’s just say I’ve been spending most of my time on that  rst investmenty thing I mentioned.\nWhen we help adviser  rms with platform suitability, we kick things off by taking a step back. Before getting in the thick of charging schedules, wrapper types, client reporting et al, we get advisers to tell us what they need to get out of day to day platform life. A huge part of this, often the biggest, is how their centralised investment proposition (CIP from hereon for our sanity) is constructed.\nThe market\nNow, research and opinion varies from source to source, but if we can proceed on the basis of the following statements then we can stay friends and crack on:\n• The vast majority of business written on platforms  ows via a CIP and\n• Of that, the majority is held in model\nportfolios and\n• There has been a continuous upwards\ntrend for investment outsourcing or in\nother words\n• We see an increasing trend towards the delineation of the advice process between  nancial planning and investment management\n• but isn’t that just a posh way of saying the same thing as the bullet before?\n• Yes, but we see a related trend within the growing lifestyle  nancial planning\nmovement where the planning element takes precedence, but the investment process for many stays insourced (urgh, horrible phrase again) by way of passive multi-asset/multi- manager or suchlike.\nThe market as it stands then can be simpli ed (of course, there will be overlap and outliers) into the following broad segments:\n • Use multi-manager/multi-asset funds  • Run model portfolios on an advisory\nbasis\n • Run model portfolios on a\ndiscretionary basis\n • Fully outsourced (DFM model portfolio\nservice or full discretionary)\nNow, because everyone likes things broken down into manageable chunks, let’s take a look at each of these approaches in turn, and some of the associated issues with running these kind of CIPs on a platform.\n "," 9\n            When we help adviser  rms with platform suitability, we kick things off by taking a step back. Before getting in the thick of charging schedules, wrapper types, client reporting et al, we get advisers to tell us what they need to get out of day to day platform life.\nMulti-manager/Multi-asset\nThe big win here is simplicity for both advisers and investors. The concept is a straightforward one for advisers to explain and for investors\nto understand. This simplicity is enhanced by the fact that any trading and rebalancing is carried out by the fund manager/s, rather than being the responsibility of the adviser (and potentially the investor too).\nThis in turn makes it tax ef cient. There are no capital gains tax implications from buying and selling unwrapped assets because it happens within the fund. And it’s extremely portable too. Most fund ranges are available on most platforms.\nThe biggest drawback, as we see it, is the single line of stock issue. How does the adviser demonstrate the work they’re doing for the client when the investment report is just a single line? Standard Life Investments have attempted to address this with its lookthrough tool for MyFolio but such initiatives are few and far between.\nRunning advisory models\nThis enables you to keep and position the investment expertise within the  rm. For small  rms it can work well, enabling them to differentiate by #demonstratingaddedvalue to the client. “I’ve noticed that your investments are slightly out of line, I can  x this for\nyou” can do wonders for the ongoing client relationship...provided you do  x it of course.\nThat’s a compelling argument but the  ip\nside to this is the admin required to run this. Whether that be version control and the\nlong trail of dead of model portfolio naming conventions (Save as “Final_Final_Final_ October18_v3”) or the act of gaining client permissions for an ad-hoc rebalance, it all adds up to a cost to your business.\nIt can be dif cult to pull this off and remain scalable. We hear lots of testimonials from small  rms who have tight process control and almost relish the challenge of it, but it’s not for everyone.\nOwn models - discretionary basis\nYou’re  rmly in control of your own destiny and can focus on investment management as opposed to platform admin. No more waiting for client permissions and farewell to messy admin, particularly if you choose a vendor (such as Seven IM, Parmenion or Standard Life) that is really kitted up to facilitate discretionary investment.\nThe most obvious downside to this approach is that obtaining discretionary permissions\nis an expensive business. Expect your cap ad requirements and PI cover costs to increase signi cantly.\nFull outsource - DFM MPS or full discretionary\nThe most obvious reason to go with this approach is to focus your activities on  nancial planning and market your business accordingly. Let the planners plan and leave\nthe investment to the specialists. Or a hybrid approach in line with new PROD guidelines i.e. I manage X segment myself and segment Y is outsourced.\nAgain, a compelling argument but this throws up a number of issues, particularly for platform usage, including:\n• It’s often expensive – clients pay advice charge + DFM access cost + platform charge + OCF of portfolios\n• Getting a robust agreement in place\n• The portfolios are rarely portable.\n• Very, very dif cult to do meaningful, side\nby side research\n• Tax consideration if your client has a GIA\nWhat does the future hold?\nWell, the future will have to wait as we’re rapidly running out of word count, not to mention we’ve barely scratched the surface of the topic. But if the good ship Capita lets me back onboard next quarter then we’ll use this as a starting point and return with a sequel\nto this article that lays out our views on the future, including some predictions on where we think the market might go.\nAs for the answers to my other questions at the start? Any day now, hopefully, south of France and because of the lang cat.\nSee you next quarter.\nVisit www.langcat nancial.co.uk for more from Steve and the rest of the lang cats.\n  ","      10\n                            The natural income buffer to sequence risk\n Andrzej Pioch and Justin Onuekwusi | Legal & General Investment Management\nBuilding a retirement pot can be psychologically dif cult – it often requires locking up today’s capital in order to save for the future. Thankfully, the order in which an investor pursues the accumulation phase does not matter all that much.\nSo long as nothing is withdrawn from the pot until retirement, the sensitivity of the pot’s total value to the sequence of events leading up to it, sequence risk (often referred to as pound-cost ravaging), is quite low. However, when an investor moves into the decumulation stage – challenges such as taking a regular retirement income, the timing of withdrawals and the level of drawdown matter a great deal, exposing the portfolio to much more sequence risk than before.\nA retired investor who is drawing down their investments for daily needs is a seller of assets. This can be particularly problematic\nif they are required to sell assets to meet spending requirements following a fall in asset prices – in other words they are forced to sell at a comparative loss. The sequence risk is subsequently high since it becomes less likely that those losses can be recovered when the market begins expanding. Conversely,\nan investor withdrawing at the height of the market is in a better position, able to sell assets at a much improved price.\nBut the investment world rarely allows investors to control the order in which market returns unfold. Even with fairly accurate medium or long-term return forecasts, predicting the path that’s going to take us there is much more challenging. Two in  ve investors withdraw the same absolute amount of cash from their funds year-on-year, regardless\nof stock market performance, the same percentage of people who receive no  nancial advice or guidance on the topic1. Hence,\napproaching sequence risk is much more about managing that risk rather than removing it altogether.\nNot all income is created equal\nIf investors in the decumulation phase are interested in receiving a regular stream of income from their portfolio, they can either opt for  xed withdrawals or natural income distributions.\nFigure 1: Illustrating the impact of different withdrawal scenarios\n 1Adviser Points of View, Retirees failing to account for market volatility as they drain funds, July 2018\n","363.38 462.33 501.37\n559.2 761.03 687.06 829.94\n1000 1283.91 1208.83 1497.16 1747.21 2158.8 2456.08 3050.51\n2870.49 2000 2488.96 2001 1924.39 2002 2325.82 2003 2624.44 2004 3202.93 2005 3739.46 2006 3938.25 2007 2759.58 2008 3590.71 2009\n4111.9 2010\n3969.6 2011 4458.04 2012 5385.63 2013 5449.09 2014 5502.42 2015 6424.25 2016 7265.66 2017 6879.47\n£350,000 £300,000 £250,000 £200,000 £150,000\n11\n 13.10% 16.75% 0.98%\nIn the  rst case, they would withdraw a  xed amount from their portfolio, for instance\na percentage of capital such as 4%, or an\n2000-2017 to a £100,000 investment and then reverse the order of the return stream. In the accumulation phase the path varies from year to year but the end outcome for the investor is exactly the same, with the investor ending the 18-year period with exactly the same amount (£238,179) whether they use the actual return stream or reverse it.\nHowever, if we assume a 4% initial withdrawal (£4,000) and assume this amount is continually drawn down each year, taking into account a 3% in ation rate as well, the results are turned on their head somewhat. If invested in the actual return stream, the investor ends up with around £50,000. If we reverse the return stream for the investor something remarkable happens.

However, investors should view the conditions this has provided as more of a mirage than a constant source of liquidity. As the mirage begins to dissipate, we believe investors should focus on bottom-up asset selection, structural diversi cation based on asset behaviour rather than labels, and a robust approach to monitoring and managing drawdown risk.\nSince the global  nancial crisis, capital markets have experienced unprecedented injections\nof liquidity through massive asset-buying programmes implemented by developed market central banks, which ‘created’ money to make these purchases. This has entailed\nan unprecedented expansion of central bank balance sheets. The combination of QE and low interest rates has kept yields on short-maturity assets low or negative, despite an apparently strong economic backdrop. This has supported the performance of many asset classes and\nput many investors on the well-documented ‘search for yield’.\nAre market participants prepared?\nAs these programmes begin to unwind and the liquidity taps close, we wonder whether market participants are prepared. We worry\nthat  nancial markets may be ill-prepared for this enormous change. Investors tend to focus on how a reversal of QE must lead to rising government bond yields (falling prices) as the supply/demand dynamic suddenly reverses. We think a singular focus on this dynamic and its effects on yields and prices is a limited view. It does not take full account of the potential rami cations, including:\n• the attractiveness of cash\n• a fall in the power of diversi cation • a broader withdrawal of liquidity\nresults in volatility.\nCash becomes attractive again\nFor the  rst time in nearly a decade, cash rates have begun to look attractive, with 3-month lending rates offering a greater yield than the US equity market. As the Fed runs down the asset\nside of its balance sheet, the ‘reserves’ available to the US banking system (which sit on the liability side) will reduce in lock step, draining liquidity from the  nancial system. It is dif cult to know at which point the resulting scarcity of access to money for the banking system might become too much, but if it does, this would put upward pressure on short-term interest rates to increase a willingness to lend. An increase in short-term interest rates marks a relative return of attractiveness for a long-forgotten asset class – cash.\nSimple diversi cation may not be enough\nIn an environment of rising cash rates, the correlation (a measure of the degree to which the returns on assets appear to move in the same direction) between government bonds\n "," 13\n  As the liquidity mirage evaporates, we believe in focusing on individual asset selection, diversifying portfolios based on asset behaviour, not traditional labels, and taking a sophisticated and energetic approach to managing drawdown risk.\nand equities increases. Investors who rely on ‘naïve’ concepts of diversi cation could then lose money on their equity and bond holdings simultaneously.\nConstructing portfolios as liquidity retreats\nHow should investors prepare for the risk of ongoing liquidity shocks? We believe there are three key levers we can pull, and we have embedded these in the Investec Diversi ed Income Fund’s investment process:\n1. Bottom-upselectionof individual assets.\nWe do not own passive strategies. In contrast to many funds which invest across asset classes we spend most of our time on the selection of individual bonds, equities and currencies based on the attractiveness of\ntheir yield, sustainability of income streams and potential for capital appreciation. This results in a more robust set of holdings with differentiated attributes to the broader market. Furthermore, we believe that limiting and indeed scaling back exposure to less-liquid securities, which are vulnerable to elevated volatility (such as high-yield debt or listed ‘alternative’ assets e.g. reinsurance bonds), is sensible in this environment.\n2. Structural diversi cation, based on how assets behave, not their labels.\nThe prospect of bond and equity returns moving in the same direction should trouble many investors who own bonds simply to offset potential losses on equities. We believe that investors should rely not on the label of an asset class, but rather on its behaviour. For this reason, we classify lower-rated corporate debt as representing the same sort of risk as equities. Furthermore, we prefer using strategies, such as options (which are currently cheap due to the absence of market volatility – a key input to their pricing), to provide a reliable offset to equity losses in the event of a market downturn, rather than relying on government bonds.\n3. Robustdrawdown management.\nWe monitor a series of quantitative metrics (such as unusual market behaviour, investor sentiment and momentum), alongside\nour own qualitative assessment, to decide whether to de-risk the portfolio. We also monitor potential event risks to determine whether speci c hedges should be used\nto reduce the strategy’s exposure to an uncertain outcome.\nFinal thoughts\nCentral banks are currently the largest participant in the bond markets and they are insensitive\nto price. Understandably, this creates a vastly different backdrop for global capital markets.\nAs the liquidity mirage evaporates, we believe in focusing on individual asset selection, diversifying portfolios based on asset behaviour, not traditional labels, and taking\na sophisticated and energetic approach to managing drawdown risk.\nTo read this Viewpoint in full and to  nd out more about the Investec Diversi ed Income Fund, please visit www.investecassetmanagement.com/DIF\nBond and Multi-Asset funds may invest more than 35% of their assets in securities issued or guaranteed by an EEA state.\nImportant information\nThis communication is for institutional investors and  nancial advisors only.

How will they afford a decent standard of living, and, even if they have a good sized pension fund, what happens to it if markets suddenly crash and they lose 20 to 30% of the value, almost overnight?\nTo take a recent scenario, between Wednesday the 3rd of October and Friday 12th October – just seven working days - UK markets fell around 7%. That’s just a snapshot, of course, but still an illustration of the volatility currently in the market.\nSuch  uctuations in the fund values can cause unnecessary stress, and concern\nin the client mind. More importantly, for those taking income these  uctuations may have a greater impact on the future value\nof their fund. We commonly know this as sequencing risk.\nAs we all know, many clients are not exposed to these dramatic  uctuations because\nthey will have an appropriately diversi ed portfolio. However, the TV news, weekend press, and radio commentary all start talk\nof the potential doom ahead and infect your clients with concern and worry about how secure their investments really are.\nOn the whole, the impact of Pension Freedom has been positive, and has given income  exibility to many. On the downside, however, it’s meant many clients taking on responsibility for investment performance, and in these turbulent economic times, that risk becomes all too real for many clients.\nOur research has shown that many clients can have a cautious attitude when it comes to investing for retirement. Advised clients are liable to have a more sophisticated awareness of investment risk, but will still have the same concerns and be reading the same headlines.\nSo for many clients, the attraction of Pension Freedom is outweighed by the risk of lost fund value, especially in the years immediately before retirement.\nThere are ways of mitigating this risk, including appropriate investment choice in terms of risk rating and capacity for loss and diversifying investment choice, as well as regular reviews and cash ow planning.\nIt’s possible that an individuals’ pension fund could be worth more than their house. Property is insured against the impact of cataclysmic event –  re,  ood – but how can clients protect their pension fund in the same way?\nFortunately, many advisers will be recommending an appropriate portfolio to their client, to provide some protection against market volatility and balance in their returns.

The guarantee ensures that in 8-10 years’ time, depending on the fund chosen, a pension fund won’t be worth any less than it is today, less any charges or income taken. If fund values have gone up, the client will get the higher value. In many cases, the opportunity to protect the value of a pension fund is seen as a worthwhile cost for clients approaching retirement.\nThe guarantee is unique as it can be switched on, off and renewed at any time, giving advisers and clients extra  exibility when it comes to retirement income planning.\nOur experience shows advisers recommending the fund in a number of circumstances: before retirement, with the added bene t of a future spot guarantee, perhaps to align with a future withdrawal date; or when an income stream is being withdrawn to protect against the sequencing risk that is ever present in our markets and perhaps magni ed in uncertain times.

These funds typically comprise equities,  xed interest and cash and some will also provide exposure to property and other alternatives. Ultimately, they rely on a professional manager to use their expertise to  nd the right balance of diversi cation in the fund. This article looks at why  nancial advisers are using multi-asset solutions, and outlines some issues to consider when choosing a multi-asset fund.\nFinancial advisers have traditionally created portfolios for clients by blending together\na selection of single-strategy funds, but\nthis creates a number of issues. The due diligence required can be a burdensome task, given the number of funds and sectors available, and portfolio construction\nrequires skilful asset allocation and fund selection to ensure adequate diversi cation. A comprehensive review process is also required in order to monitor the portfolios on an ongoing basis. Given these issues, advisers are increasingly acknowledging the advantages of outsourcing this specialist discipline, and one solution is multi-asset funds. Multi-asset funds can also be more cost effective and can free up time to spend on tasks that provide added value for clients.\nAccording to data from the Investment Association (IA) in July 2018, the total assets under management in mixed-asset funds was £145bn. This incorporates the following IA sectors – Mixed Investment 0-35% Shares, 0-60% Shares and 40-85% Shares, UK Equity and Bond Income and the Flexible Investment sector. When we include the IA Volatility Managed sector (£27.6bn), we can estimate that multi-asset funds account for circa £173bn or nearly 15% of the total UK fund universe. There are nearly 700 funds listed in the sectors above which is approximately 20% of the overall universe. So how does an adviser choose the most suitable?\n In selecting multi-asset solutions, an adviser must  rst consider the risk appetite and return objectives of the client – whether a fund is ‘risk targeted’ or ‘return focused’ could be the starting point.\n  "," 17\n  Advisers are increasingly acknowledging the advantages of outsourcing this specialist discipline, and one solution is multi-asset funds. Multi-asset funds can also be more cost effective and can free up time to spend on tasks that provide added value for clients.\nMulti-asset funds come in various forms and the chart below offers a framework to help advisers identify the key characteristics and differences between these funds:\ntheir ‘fund of fund’ structures. There are also asset class variations in that some funds will have a traditional split between equities and  xed interest only while other funds will include alternative asset classes such\nas property, commodities, infrastructure or derivative based strategies.\nIn selecting multi-asset solutions, an adviser must  rst consider the risk appetite and return objectives of the client – whether a fund is\n‘risk targeted’ or ‘return focused’ could be the starting point. The funds available cover a wide range of risk pro les and this too can be used to help narrow the universe. Many are mapped to a risk pro ling provider which can be useful when comparing funds. Cost is important and varies widely, driven mainly by the underlying holdings in the fund. A cost-conscious investor may be more suited to a passive or blended approach which includes direct exposure\nor even a fettered fund of funds. A more sophisticated client may be willing to accept higher charges for this style of investing. It can be appropriate to blend a number multi-asset solutions in a client portfolio to optimise the bene ts from a range of investment styles. Selecting suitable multi-asset funds and managers still requires a high level of due diligence, but there are inherent advantages to this approach which may be more suitable for certain advisory businesses depending on their underlying clients.\nRSMR provide specialist research services for multi-asset solutions.

Risk targeted funds typically\ncomprise a range, whereby each fund will\nhave targeted volatility boundaries. These funds normally sit in the IA Volatility managed sector. Return focused funds aim to outperform a speci ed benchmark (e.g. CPI +3%) with risk being a secondary consideration.

As anyone familiar with our investment process will know, one of our core beliefs\nis that while consistency of performance\nis ultimately impossible, consistency of approach – at least for our chosen managers – is vital.\nWith that in mind, one of the most interesting sessions for me focused\non Morningstar’s efforts to improve performance measurement, proposing two new metrics called longest underperformance and outperformance periods (LUP and LOP respectively).\nAs we all know, returns from actively managed funds are compared against pre-selected benchmarks to determine ‘outperformance’. While this seems a straightforward exercise, it is complicated by the fact a fund that ultimately beats its benchmark over a certain timeframe may go through stretches of underperformance within that period. These stretches can\nbe particularly stark if a fund has a strong\nstyle bias and the market goes against that approach at particular times.\nWe can point to several well-known instances of this from the recent past; value- oriented managers were dismissed as out of touch dinosaurs during the excesses of the TMT bubble in the late 1990s, for example.\nWhen looking at its LUP and LOP measures, Morningstar examined a global set of active funds over a 15-year period from January 2003 to December 2017 and found a number of interesting things.\nAround two-thirds of the funds analysed - 3,790 out of 5,500 - beat their benchmarks over the 15-year period but of these, the average LUP ranged from nine to 11 years. What this means in practice is that investors\nnot only needed to pick the right managers but also have the patience to endure long periods of sub-par returns.\nThe opposite is also true: a fund that ultimately underperforms its benchmark over a 15-year period could well have gone through an eight-year period of outperformance, enticing return-chasing investors to buy the fund, only to be disappointed by subsequent results.\nTo show the data on this, of 1,710 funds that ultimately underperformed over the 15-year period, 1,164 had an average LOP of 11 years. Again in practice, this means it would have ultimately have been a mistake to judge a fund’s ability to outperform on a track record as long as 11 years.\n As anyone familiar with our investment process will know, one of our core beliefs is that while consistency of performance is ultimately impossible, consistency of approach – at least for our chosen managers – is vital.\n "," 19\n  On our Verbatim Portfolio Growth range, we select funds and managers that complement each other in terms of investment style. It is key, therefore, that managers have a track record of maintaining a particular style and do not drift away from it: if they do, this is a reason for us to sell out.\nUsing simulations, Morningstar showed that even a very skilled manager, over a span\nof 100 years, would underperform his/her benchmark for a period of 20 years at some point during that time.\nSo what can we take from all this? A\nkey point for us, which chimes with our investment process, is that patience has to be a watchword when it comes to investing – which is increasingly out of step with the short-termism of markets and much of the commentary about them.\nAs Morningstar concludes, active investing\nis a long game but many of the standard performance metrics that measure it – which investors continue to rely on when selecting funds despite warnings – are not built around this. Alpha, beta, and information ratio for example all typically use three or  ve years as their default timeframe but\nthis data shows those periods are too short to evaluate a manager with any degree of con dence. Even stretching it to a decade isn’t going far enough.\nFor Morningstar, these  ndings should encourage investors to recalibrate their expectations.\n“Asset management  rms should perhaps rethink how they structure their bonuses for active managers,” said the group.\n“Most importantly, perhaps, investors who have con dence in their pick need a big dose of patience, an investing virtue that has not been emphasised enough. It turns out that even if you have the acumen to pick a good manager, this may be of little avail if your patience fails you.”\nWhile it is very early days for LUP and LOP,\nI would suggest they could eventually prove to a useful tool in support of our consistency of process focus: as we have long said, we are often buying particular managers to\n t a style requirement in our portfolios\nand therefore want them to keep to that approach.\nBaked into that is the understanding that managers with a strong style bias can go through lengthy period of underperformance but we want to see consistency of process whatever the market is doing in the background.\nOn our Verbatim Portfolio Growth range, we select funds and managers that complement each other in terms of investment style. It\nis key, therefore, that managers have a track record of maintaining a particular style and do not drift away from it: if they do, this is a reason for us to sell out.\nJohn Husselbee is the co-fund manager for the Verbatim Portfolio Growth Fund range, part of the Verbatim range of risk-managed multi-asset investment solutions.

He or she trusts that the adviser will provide proper guidance and oversight of their  nances.\nOnce, trust in  nancial institutions – and in  nancial advisers – was widely taken\nfor granted. But the global  nancial crisis of 2008–2009 eroded many investors’ con dence in the people and organisations charged with managing money.\nThe bond of trust you share with your clients is the cornerstone of your relationship, and of your business. Recent Vanguard research examines the role of trust in the adviser- client relationship and the factors that can strengthen or weaken it.\nA brief summary follows, or you can read the report in its entirety.\nThe components of trust\nIn 2015 and 2016, Vanguard surveyed nearly 4,000 advised investors in the United States to gain insight into how trust is built between advisers and clients.\nWe identi ed three components of trust – functional, emotional and ethical. Although the emotional aspect was generally regarded\nas most important each component contributes to the overall assessment of an adviser’s trustworthiness and a failure in any component can compromise trust.\nWhat drives trust – and what breaks it\nPutting the components of trust into effect requires knowing the speci c qualities or behaviours associated with each type of trust.\n   The components of trust\nFUNCTIONAL ATTRIBUTES\nRelevant  nancial industry quali cations. Awareness of trends in the markets.\nKnowing how to conceive, execute and reassess a  nancial plan.\nEMOTIONAL ATTRIBUTES\nAbility to see things from clients’ perspectives.\nAbility to relate to or make a connection with clients.\nGiving clients a sense of relief and security.\nServing as clients’ advocate, pursuing their goals almost as if they were his or her own.\nETHICAL ATTRIBUTES\nPossessing integrity.\nHaving no con icts of interest or ulterior motives.\nActing in clients’ interests at all times. Compensated fairly.\n Source: Vanguard. Note:1\n "," 21\n  Our research found that being the client’s advocate and acting in his or her best interest are the top two factors that determine overall trust.\nOur research found that being the client’s advocate and acting in his or her best interest are the top two factors that determine overall trust. Each was almost twice as in uential as the third identi ed factor – having an adviser who “is someone I can relate to.” Even seemingly critical attributes such as “no con ict of interest” and “does what he/she says he/ she will” scored lower in driving adviser trustworthiness.\nAbout one-quarter of the respondents in our study had had an experience that undermined their trust in their  nancial adviser (either their current adviser or a previous one).\nThere may be multiple reasons for an investor to distrust an adviser. The reasons most commonly cited relate to investment performance and neglecting the relationship. Additional reasons given included other emotional and ethical aspects of the relationship.\nBuilding and sustaining trust\nFinancial advisers can employ a variety of approaches to manage trust proactively. These can involve standards of ethical\nand  duciary conduct, the pricing and quality of products and services, types of compensation arrangements, and a focus\non elements of emotional, ethical and functional trust embedded in their marketing and client experience.\nIt’s not enough for  nancial advisers simply to do what they are hired to do. An advisory relationship needs to be continuously nurtured. Being the client’s advocate and acting in his or her best interest top the list of attributes that are central to building trust.\nTrust is associated with client loyalty and positive outcomes for the advisory business. It’s clear, therefore, that advisers should seek to manage trust proactively.\nLearn more – and take action\nYou’ll  nd much more information on the importance of trust in the adviser-client relationship in our report.

Our two income funds, the Premier Multi-Asset Distribution Fund and the Premier Multi- Asset Monthly Income Fund, are in the  rst camp: they live to generate income.\nThis might seem like semantics: there have been many income income funds that have generated great total returns, and plenty\nof total-return income funds that have generated a decent income. But it may matter for your clients. Occasionally markets throw up situations that force managers to choose between maintaining high income distributions and trying to avoid short-term volatility. Knowing whether your fund is focused on income or total return could help you to swerve disappointment on this front.\nTake the environment today. On one hand, some markets seem stretched and politics look dicey, but on the other, traditional\nsafe havens, such as cash or gilts, don’t\noffer much income (particularly compared to in ation). A total-return manager, particularly if running a top-down, “macro” process, might sell their dividend-paying UK equities and bolt for the perceived safety\nof cash. However, doing so, especially for prolonged periods, will dent their income stream. This, in turn, will have consequences for any clients relying on that income to pay their bills.\nAn income-focused manager, however, should be more wary of damaging their fund’s income stream. We, for example, would describe ourselves as cautiously positioned in respect of our equity exposure. But we can also see that, with a yield\nof more than 4.4%, UK equities look an attractive income prospect. Not just because they yield more than cash or gilts, but because company dividends can potentially grow to counter in ation too. This is particularly important for the newly retired.\n This combination of disciplines has made income investing a powerful draw for UK investors. We believe its slow-and- steady approach is one of the surest ways to see them through the raft of uncertainties they currently face, just as it has for decades before this.\n ","  23\n                        Occasionally markets throw up situations that force managers to choose between maintaining high income distributions and trying to avoid short-term volatility. Knowing whether your fund is focused on income or total return could help you to swerve disappointment on this front.\nHowever, while our focus is income, that doesn’t mean we don’t care about total returns. Far from it: concentrating on income can, paradoxically, lead to better total returns too.\nThis is because of the discipline it imposes. For one, the need to keep generating income lowers the risk of managers “panicking”\nout of the market. There’s usually a scary reason to think markets are about to collapse (take 2012’s Cypriot banking crisis that had everyone in a lather – remember that?). We’ve seen many peers succumb to such fears over the last decade, invariably to the detriment of their clients. The commitment to produce steady income acts as a commitment to staying invested.\nComplimentary to that, and this is the beauty of it, is that income investing also commits us to avoiding two of the other\nbig risks that bring down funds: paying too much for assets or over-estimating assets’ quality. For the former, the more expensive an asset becomes, the further its yield falls, making it more likely an income manager will sell it. For the latter, if we wish to maintain our income stream, we need to ensure the assets we’ve chosen (or the managers we’ve picked to choose those assets for us) are of suf cient quality to keep paying that income.\nThose attributes are highly effective, but there’s one more discipline we need to maximise our chances of defending an income stream: diversi cation. Sometimes\nit doesn’t matter how good your analysis\nis; if you’re only invested in one thing, it\ncan be damaged by simple bad luck. That “one thing” could be anything from a single property, share or bond through to a country, region or asset class. Either way, ensuring\nour Funds’ income streams are permanently diversi ed reduces the risk of bad luck, while also allowing us to access the best opportunities available.\nThis combination of disciplines has made income investing a powerful draw for UK investors.

At Goldman Sachs Asset Management, we think this is now turning as US growth is likely to moderate from the strong pace in the second quarter and converge somewhat with the rest of the world. We think this convergence creates the potential for a comeback in emerging market assets.\nWe expect some moderation in US\ngrowth and continued consolidation in\nthe long-end of US rates to be important aspects of the macro environment towards year-end. We think concerns about trade and EM contagion are overdone. We expect this macro environment to drive a comeback in EM assets after their recent underperformance.\nFrom growth divergence since the spring ...\nEarlier in the year, we highlighted 1) upside risks to the US and Japanese growth outlook; 2) downside risks for Europe and\nChina; and 3) reduced interest rate risk after the sharp rise in rates we had seen. Together we thought these developments created a better balance of risks. Since then, the S&P 500 reached a new high and the US printed a very strong 4.2% growth in the second quarter. At the\nsame time, we have seen weaker data in Europe and in China which, together with trade tensions, renewed market concerns about the Chinese growth outlook. In EM outside of China, growth has been weaker than we expected which, in addition to several country-speci c risks, has caused signi cant underperformance in EM assets against our expectations.\n... to renewed growth convergence ...\nWe now think this exceptional period of US outperformance is largely behind us. The US bene tted from strong  scal policy support in the second quarter, which is likely to fade over time. Meanwhile, growth in Europe appears to be stabilising at a lower but more sustainable level than we saw late last year. The recovery in Japan, which had been more muted than we expected, is gradually continuing. In China, policy support has been  rm in the face of weaker data and risks from trade, which we think will eventually generate a period of positive surprises. Outside of China, most EM countries have healthy economic fundamentals and should bene t from US growth. In our view, the weakness in EM assets re ects country-speci c challenges rather than a broad EM crisis, and the bigger picture is one of global growth converging at healthy levels after a period de ned by US exceptionalism.\n We expect some moderation in US growth and continued consolidation in the long-end of US rates to be important aspects of the macro environment towards year-end.\n "," 25\n  EM assets will be the clearest bene ciary, supported by our view that market fears of trade tensions and EM contagion are likely to prove overdone. More generally, we would also expect the US dollar strength to start to fade.\n Key Findings\n1. US exceptionalism has peaked\nWe think the period of diverging growth rates - driven by strong US outperformance is largely behind us. US growth bene tted from strong support from  scal policy in the second quarter, which is likely to fade over time.\n2. Interest rates are likely to remain near current levels into year-end\nWe expect US interest rates to continue climbing over the longer term, but we see few catalysts for another signi cant move higher this year. With in ation rising gradually and US growth likely to moderate, we expect the Federal Reserve (Fed) to raise rates twice more in 2018, consistent with market pricing.\n3. A challenging investment environment, but fertile for an EM comeback\nTrade tensions, political developments\nand the potential for a moderation in\nUS growth raise the risk of a temporary pullback in equities later this year. However, we think US growth will remain above trend and economic fundamentals in most EM countries remain healthy, creating fertile ground for a comeback in EM assets.\n... and continued consolidation of long end US rates\nIn the spring, we thought interest rate\nrisk would return later this year after\na period of consolidation in long-term rates. However, that consolidation now looks likely to continue until around the turn of the year. The market is pricing approximately 45 basis points of additional Fed rate hikes in 2018, suggesting markets will not be surprised if the Fed delivers the two hikes we expect. At the same time, in ation has been slow to  rm, with the acceleration in year-over-year numbers this year largely re ecting base effects. With gradual in ation and a likely moderation in US growth, we think the Fed will want to keep its options open by waiting at least until the run-up to the December meeting to signal a more aggressive pace of rate hikes in 2019. We see plenty of signs of  rming in ation, but we think it will take time before in ation becomes strong enough to impact monetary policy more signi cantly.\nA challenging investment landscape to navigate ...\nWe think the investment environment will remain challenging to navigate and we continue to favour a dynamic approach\nto investment. Trade and geopolitics are likely to be a continued source of volatility, and moderation in US growth could well lead to a temporary sell-off in US equities.\nWe also worry about Italy’s budget negotiations and the outlook for Italian growth. Despite these challenges, we think continued economic expansion and decent earnings growth will leave developed market (DM) equities higher by year-\nend. That said, we are less bullish on DM equities than we were earlier in the year as equities have recovered signi cantly. Also, while this update focuses on the rest of 2018, as we move into 2019 the risk to US growth becomes more nuanced as Fed policy continues to tighten while the impact of  scal stimulus moderates further.\n... but fertile for an EM Comeback\nWe think the recent US economic outperformance, combined with softer growth in many other economies, has been an underappreciated factor behind asset performance in general in recent months and EM underperformance in particular. We therefore see the shift to convergence- --with US growth moderating while other economies stabilize as signi cant. We think EM assets will be the clearest bene ciary, supported by our view that market fears of trade tensions and EM contagion are likely to prove overdone. More generally, we would also expect the US dollar strength to start to fade.\nFor more information visit\nwww.gsam.com\n ","         26\n   Retirement options under the FCA microscope\n Danny Knight | Head of Investment Directors | Quilter Investors\nDanny Knight, head of investment directors at Quilter Investors, explains why the  ndings of the FCA’s Retirement Outcomes Review show there is still plenty of room for improvement in the decumulation investment market.\nWhen pension freedoms were introduced in 2015, newspapers heralded the  exibility and choice suddenly available, while politicians celebrated liberating their constituents from the perils of the annuity market.\nBritons were quick to embrace the reforms. In less than two years,  exible income payments totalling £9.2bn had been made from UK pension pots. This huge behaviour shift at retirement provided the backbone for a new era of face-to-face  nancial advice. But crucially, it also presents some big challenges that are putting consumers at risk of sub-optimal retirement outcomes, according to a recent FCA report.\nThe surprise reforms were implemented at short notice by a Chancellor eager to secure support ahead of the 2015 General Election and took many by surprise. Like most seismic policy changes, while the positive bene ts were obvious, they came with unintended consequences that take time to percolate.\nFree ‘guidance’ has been introduced in a belated attempt to address knowledge gaps.\nAction is being taken against the threat of cold calling. And we have recently seen new rules on pension transfers.\nBut there are many other unintended consequences creating  res that need to be extinguished to protect retirees.\nTime to review\nThe FCA’s recently published Retirement Outcomes Review illustrates how much catch-up is still required. It includes some startling discoveries about the behaviours, bias and attitudes of consumers in drawdown. More than anything else, its  ndings highlight that there are still plenty of challenges ahead.\nFear of loss\nThe FCA found that the single biggest driver motivating decisions was a fear of losing money. Over half (52%) rated it as “very important” in shaping their at-retirement choices and fewer than 1 in 10 said they felt it was not a major concern. “As long as it doesn’t lose money, I will be satis ed,” was the response of one individual surveyed on\nher investment choices.\nAnother retiree aged 65+ explained that they were concerned about investing “because I’m against gambling, always have been. I like to know that things are safe, things are in place.”\nCash\nPerhaps as a result of this fear of loss,\nthe FCA found that 1 in 3 non-advised drawdown customers are entirely invested in cash. In total, the regulator estimates 50,000 are exclusively holding cash in  exible drawdown, while we estimate that 10% of all retirees taking  exible income in the 2017/18 tax year were entirely in cash.\nThe FCA found this has a “signi cant cumulative impact on retirement income”. And it concludes that few are using cash as a short term safe haven and instead “remain in cash for a prolonged period”.\nIt estimates that an individual in cash could increase their annual income by more than a third if they invested in a mix of assets, including equities.\n ","   27\n        The battle is on to ensure the industry matches the pension revolution with bold answers in the way that it manages investment risk in retirement by engaging those clients concerned about losing money, and demonstrate to them the importance of delivering returns within risk parameters that meet their retirement needs.\nInvestment risk\nConsumers are rightly worried about loss in retirement. Unlike accumulation investors, they are less likely to be able to leave their savings untouched to recover market falls, or top-up their pot from earnings.\nBut the temptation to withdraw into cash is a dangerous one. It places retirees at\nrisk from in ation, the corrosive effects of which seem to be under-appreciated. Rates on cash, according to the Bank of England, are somewhere in the region of 0.9%, while in ation is well above 2%, putting the real rate of return well in negative territory.\nThe answer for many people will be an investment solution that offers growth potential alongside appropriate downside protection.\nRisk and rewards\nFor investors in the accumulation phase of their retirement planning, volatility can be\na price worth paying for the opportunity to realise long-term gains. In decumulation, however, losses can be compounded when assets are sold during a downturn. This is the dreaded ‘sequence of return risk’ or ‘pound cost ravaging’ as it is variously known.\nAs the FCA paper notes: “Volatility is particularly important for drawdown consumers as they may rely on the income from their pot and so do not want its value to change too drastically.”\nHowever, the regulator found little consistency in the risk/reward balance in investments used for decumulation, with\naround a third of the drawdown investments it analysed delivering a poor risk-reward ratio based on the relationship between performance and total charges.\nThe value of advice\nCustomers using an adviser confront these challenges with the bene t of expert support.\nThe report found more consistent and logical patterns in the choices made by advised customers in comparison to those not taking advice.\nIt says that: “While advised consumers seem to invest with a pattern consistent with their pro les, consumers that do not take advice do not. For example, investments in higher- risk assets, such as equity funds, increase for advised consumers in larger pots who have not made withdrawals. We did not see a similar trend for consumers without advice.”\nIt also found that 94% of non-advised customers stay with their incumbent provider when moving into drawdown, compared with 35% of advised customers, showing they are much more inclined to search the market for the most appropriate options.\nWhat comes next?\nThe report shows there is still work to be done to address a number of emerging issues in the decumulation market. The FCA is taking steps now to tackle the number of retirees ending up in cash, and to encourage consumers to make more active choices at retirement, particularly where non-advised customers are concerned.\nWhere it has recommended changes, these will be adopted in rules (a policy statement) to be published in January 2019, with further consultation on wider concerns also due in 2019.\nIt is now up to the industry to demonstrate that it can deliver the right outcomes for customers.\nTherefore, the battle is on to ensure the industry matches the pension revolution with bold answers in the way that it manages investment risk in retirement by engaging those clients concerned about losing money, and demonstrate to them the importance of delivering returns within risk parameters that meet their retirement needs.\nTo  nd out more about strategies in decumulation, visit www.quilterinvestors. com/generationrange\nTo speak to an Investment Director call 0207 167 3700 or email enquiries@quilterinvestors.com\nImportant information\nPast performance is not a guide to future performance and\nmay not be repeated.

This often means having to make a compromise somewhere along the line when constructing a retirement income solution, in part because we still have broadly the same retirement products to choose from that we have had for the last 20 years.\nAnd yet what people expect from retirement has moved on. In spite of this, retirees are seemingly continuing to put all of their retirement eggs in one product basket. Either opting for drawdown, or an annuity.\nNew research from actuarial  rm Milliman has found that there is a case for considering a blend of products. This provides (in many instances) better long-term outcomes for retirement income provision and death bene ts.\nIf retirees are looking for a mix of  exibility and guarantees, is it the case that the simplest solution is the right one?\nResistance to change?\n‘Blending’ seems to be something that everyone thinks is a good idea, but there\ndoesn’t seem to be much evidence of it happening.\nThis is understandable, the preference of today’s retiree seems to be for retaining total access rather than feeling ‘locked in’. And we see this re ected in advisers’ current business models. Assets under management through platforms are where many adviser  rms do business now.\nHowever, is this approach future proofed?\nIs there a hidden danger of failure in the future due to the need to satisfy today’s commercial requirements? This doesn’t necessarily mean that advisers should change the way they apply their fees. It’s more a case of making a link between the value that fees will generate, and the risk that a retiree’s pension funds could deplete over time. If\na retiree’s funds run out as they are spent down, so does the adviser’s income stream.\nAre we sleepwalking into future problems?\nDrawdown purchases are now outnumbering annuities by nearly 3 to 11. Those individuals have to accept that they shoulder all of the risks.\nThis not only includes longevity and investment risks, but more subtle issues that need attention, such as whether they have adapted their portfolio criteria. The demands of decumulation are very different to the accumulation phase.\nDelivering a sustainable rate of drawdown income might currently seem like a walk\nin the park, given that investors have experienced a good run of stock market returns recently. But what happens when there is a market correction? The global political and economic disruptors at play, such as potentially harmful global tariffs, diminishing QE, and the sensitivity of interest rate changes are all creating a perfect investment storm.\nThe fallback position for drawdown portfolios is to hold  xed interest and corporate bond type funds in order to diversify. However, yields are not what they used to be, and these funds are not immune to volatility either.\nIf the methods of the past cannot be relied upon, where do you go?\n1 FCA Monthly Data Bulletin - September 2018\n "," 29\n  The search for alternatives\nThere are an increasing number of research papers that raise doubts about the validity of trying to retain fund growth and provide sustainable income solely from invested sources. And they go further to suggest a blend of investment and annuity has real merit in achieving many retirees’ goals.\nMorningstar – their paper ‘Safe withdrawal rates for retirees in the United Kingdom’2  nally updated the 4% ‘Bengen’ rule: “... these  ndings suggest that  nancial advisers and retirees in the United Kingdom should use lower initial safe withdrawal rates...2.5% or 3.0% and not the previous 4.0%”.\nInstitute and Faculty of Actuaries – The March 2018 paper ‘Can we help consumers avoid running out of money in retirement?’3 also backed up a lower safe withdrawal rate if relying on investment only: “Consumers can reduce the risk of a low income due to living longer than expected or adverse market conditions by combining drawdown with annuities”.\nThey also investigated combining drawdown with an annuity: “Our modelling compared consumers who either bought just a drawdown product or just an annuity with different strategies that combine both drawdown and annuitisation. We found that a combination of products is bene cial”.\nMilliman – ‘Annuities reinvented’4 stochastically models the question of what happens if you replace bonds with an annuity:\n• “Our analysis indicates that, for longer periods of retirement, a combination of an annuity income and drawing down from an equity investment fund could lead to a higher likelihood of achieving a person’s target income and a higher death bene t compared to drawing down from a mixed bond and equity investment fund”.\nThis can be been seen from the following chart that plots different degrees of health for annuity rates, and compares against bonds over a 35-year period.\n 2Morningstar - Safe withdrawal rates for retirees in the United Kingdom 2016\n3Institute and Faculty of Actuaries - Can we help consumers avoid running out of money in retirement? 2018 4Milliman – Annuities Reinvented 2018\nSource: Milliman – Annuities Reinvented 2018\nMilliman also considered the impact on death bene ts to see what the difference would be:\n•\n“Our analysis indicates that, for longer periods of retirement, a combination of an annuity income and drawing down from an equity investment fund could lead to a higher likelihood of achieving ... a higher death bene t compared to drawing down from a mixed bond and equity investment fund”.\n This supports the idea that an annuity underpin can in many instances unshackle the equity fund to go for growth, providing a better outcome for retirees.\nConclusion\nThere are many commentators bemoaning the lack of new products for today’s retirement needs. New products will be forthcoming eventually, however the lack of progress is not surprising when you consider the enormous costs involved to bring a new product to market.\nIn the meantime, the innovation is already right in front of us. It is creating solutions built from the component parts of the product frameworks we already have at our disposal. Investment for  exibility and guaranteed products for essential income.\nThe simplest solutions are often the best, however, building and maintaining a good retirement solution isn’t easy, and requires skills and knowledge that makes advisers invaluable.\nSource: Milliman – Annuities Reinvented 2018\n","           30\n                        Retirement planning and sustainable withdrawal rates – an update\n Eric Armstrong | Client Director | Synaptic Software Limited\nMost of us will be familiar now with the starting point for most discussions of this kind – the Bengen 4% rule.\nThis research was a landmark in establishing a new kind of calculation, but Bengen’s research only dealt with US historical returns, and our intention here is to outline how Bengen’s approach might be applied in a UK retirement context today, using modern stochastic techniques.\nFirst of all, the use of cash- ow plans\nAs readers will know, cash- ow models are prescribed for DB transfers, but in his recent report ’An-ex-regulator’s guide to cash- ow planning’, Rory Percival explains why cash-  ow plans should be taking centre stage in a wider context of advice:\n• ‘Cash- ow planning can be about any form of income and outgoings and does not have to be related to the client’s overall position.’ A cash- ow plan need not be a holistic view of a client’s  nances.\n• The second point is that the cash- ow plan can establish a client’s capacity for Loss for most clients. In fact, writes the author ‘it should be the main\nway of assessing Capacity for Loss for most clients’. Capacity for Loss\nis the lynchpin of compliance and meeting the funding requirement for future income is central to any plan. An adviser needs to make an expert, objective assessment of Capacity for Loss, or using its FCA de nition,\nidentify the level at which loss may make a ‘material impact on the standard of living’.\nSynaptic users can use growth assumptions from the Synaptic Risk pro le, but the calculations remain deterministic.\nUse of stochastic modelling to demonstrate the possible investment outcomes\n• Financial planning in Synaptic Modeller is built around a forward-looking methodology that takes the markets as they exist now, and studies the whole range of ‘viable’ outcomes. This is increasingly proven as a superior technique to basing assumptions on previous market conditions.\n• The great gift of the Moody’s Analytics stochastic model is the ability to ascribe the extent of losses to a portfolio in a bad year (covered in subsequent article) and the ability\nto ascribe probability to possible outcomes.\nTo illustrate the dynamics of risk over the period of a client’s retirement, we ran some scenarios in Synaptic Modeller, a tool that accesses the Moody’s stochastic model. We looked at the probability of success for a couple who are approaching retirement (age 59), looking to retire at 65, and we\nare modelling to try and understand what investment strategy to apply to ISA holdings\nthat have accumulated over the years (so no tax implications). As our clients have their\nbills covered with pension income and state income, this is purely discretionary spend.\nOur client and his wife however both have a balanced risk pro le, so it will be dif cult to recommend a solution that takes them over this threshold. The research however, points to the need to take risk on.\nThese illustrations are ‘real’ so include outcomes across the full range of viable variants for in ation and interest rates. (One advantage of the stochastic approach is the built-in stress testing).\nThe percentage withdrawal rate is an ‘initial withdrawal rate’, which is subject to an annual uplift of 2.7% (current CPI) to maintain purchasing power.\nIn our  rst graph, the green line represents the probability-based outcomes for £100k invested in the Balanced portfolio in our C.I.P., (projections are calculated using asset allocation). The red line represents the projections from our C.I.P.’s Adventurous strategy, and the blue line is Cautious.\nWe are aiming for a nominal £50k remainder in the pot at 95 years old as our de nition of success.\n"," 31\n STRATEGY / WITHDRAWAL RATE\n  2%\n 4%\n 6%\n CAUTIOUS\n 34%\n  0\n 0\n BALANCED\n 73%\n  32%\n 8%\n ADVENTUROUS\n 76%\n  53%\n 33%\nRISK LEVEL\n 10% BEST OUTCOMES\n 10% WORST OUTCOMES\n RANGE (90TH TO 10TH PERCENTILES)\n CAUTIOUS\n >£9.6k\n <-£43.8k\n £54k\n BALANCED\n >£129k\n <-£35k\n £165k\n ADVENTUROUS\n >£432k\n <-£48k\n £480k\n                                 Here are the results. Probability of success (£50k remaining) from our scenario:\nWhat really hits home is the impact of in ation. If I were run the scenario on a nominal basis the results are obviously very different. The temptation is of course to show the nominal projections to the client.. 85-90% chance of success.. but this would be half the story:\nThe ranges of possible outcomes is large (I have shown the range for 80% of the outcomes in the table). Clearly a plan will need to be carefully monitored, because adjustments can and should be made depending on the sequence of returns in the early years. If all is well, more money will be able to be extracted, but a poor sequence of returns initially will necessitate a constriction of the withdrawal rate and recovery time for the fund.\nA major concern of course is the cognitive ability of the client (and the adviser!) in later years, so the due diligence and research needs to be very thorough, including understanding of how the reviews will be undertaken. The sensible approach here is to work with a Withdrawal Statement that sets out the expectations and rules to address different market conditions. This is also the best way to demonstrate the suitability of the plan, as the rules will be designed to prevent the depletion of the principal and breach of the client’s Capacity for Loss.\nThere are many interesting considerations that come out of this research, for example how different asset allocations and investment styles might work; whether the use of natural yield to determine withdrawal rates might help, and my favourite, allowing the asset classes to drift.. which again provides some really interesting results and options for the adviser. Maybe a topic for next time.\n     This is what the graph looks like, mapping investment outcomes from the simulation per £100k invested against probability for the three strategies..\n Conclusions\nIt can be inferred from our research that a ‘safe initial withdrawal rate’ would be signi cantly less than the 4-6% I will recommend to my client. Looking at the £0  nal fund value, I can see a balanced strategy would suggest a 65% chance of success for the strategy to last the distance. Remember that Bengen didn’t allow for costs, where I have allowed 1%.\n All illustrations are from Synaptic Modeller.

To put this into context, today the average 60-year-old female in the UK has a 34% chance of living beyond 90 (that’s 2.1 times more likely than in 1980), while the average 60-year-old male has a\n23% chance (that’s a staggering 4 times more likely than in 1980)1. The implications of these increasing life expectancies for  nancial planning in a time where paternalistic  nal salary schemes have become a thing of the past are immense.\nOff the back of the success of the shared value approach of our life and health insurance businesses, and considering the nature of\nthe challenges that face this market, we’ve identi ed long-term savings as the next opportunity for innovation built around improving customer outcomes. Hence, the launch of our new business VitalityInvest.\nAs you may know, our insurance businesses\nare underpinned by a shared value model, which has already resonated with over a million Vitality health and life insurance clients.\nIf you’re not familiar with the concept, shared value was de ned in a Harvard Business Review article by Professor Michael Porter2 and Mark Kramer3: it’s a framework to create economic value, while at the same time addressing a societal need. The idea is simple: business models can and should address social issues\nto generate pro t. Vitality’s business model is an application of this in the insurance world: we reward our clients for taking care of their health. This results in lower claims for us, and we channel some of these savings back to our clients in the form of additional rewards and lower premiums. This creates a virtuous and self-reinforcing cycle that results in more loyal clients, as well as a healthier, more productive society. Simply put, the economic value we create simultaneously bene ts clients, advisers, ourselves and society.\nBy launching VitalityInvest, we see an opportunity to incorporate this shared value model into unique pre- and post-retirement investment solutions, enabling clients to bene t from shared value over their lifetime.\nAs a result of our extensive global experience in this space4, we’ve built up data on more than 40 million life years of the correlation between incentives and behaviour change.\nThis allows us to design innovative products that encourage and reward positive health and savings behaviours.\nWe believe these products will encourage your clients to start saving earlier, take care of their health, and manage income responsibly throughout retirement. This in turn will generate additional revenue for us, which we can channel back to your clients to further enhance their investments.\nAt the same time, we’ve collaborated with world-renowned research partners at\nthe University of Cambridge and RAND Corporation to develop sophisticated algorithms that model the complex links between health, lifestyle behaviours and longevity. This allows us to create advanced  nancial planning tools that will enable\nyou to incorporate personalised health information into retirement planning for your clients, emphasising the vitally important links between health, longevity and  nancial planning.\nSee how our positively different investments can help your clients live longer, healthier, more  nancially secure lives at adviser.vitality.co.uk/invest.\nFor investment professionals only.

Not anymore.\n  Katya MacLean | Proposition Director | Guardian\nGuardian is a famous name in  nancial services with a long history helping to protect families since 1821. We’re delighted to be bringing this 197-year-old brand back to life.\nOur ambition is for every family to have protection that they truly believe in. We\nwon’t achieve that by following protection • norms. We’ve looked at every aspect\nof protection proposition design and\nchallenged it. We’ve been bold. •\nOur biggest challenge to the norm is\nour critical illness de nitions. Typically, providers de ne the quality of their critical illness policies by the number of illnesses • they cover. At Guardian, we’re focused on offering the best possible cover for the\nmost common illnesses. We’ve done this\nby simplifying our policy wording, making • it easy for advisers to recommend, and\ntheir clients to understand what they’re covered for.\nOur cancer de nitions are broader than most, a Guardian policy covers all malignant cancers including all malignant skin cancers. Heart attack is simply based on diagnosis by a UK Consultant alone. We don’t ask\nfor evidence of raised troponin levels – it’s future proofed.\nWe pay on all types of stroke diagnosed by a UK Consultant, including death\nof optic nerve or eye strokes, where symptoms last for 24 hours.\nMultiple sclerosis We pay on diagnosis only. The policyholder doesn’t have to be exhibiting symptoms at claim.\nOn top of that, to make sure all our critical illness policies are future proof, we’re offering our existing customers a unique promise. If our critical illness de nitions improve, in most cases we’ll apply the improvements to their policies completely free of charge. If they make a claim, we check it against both the de nitions\nthey bought and the de nitions for new customers. And we pay out if the claim is valid under either. Occasionally, we may introduce changes that we won’t automatically upgrade. If this happens, we’ll offer existing customers the chance to pay to add them.\nLet’s look at some examples:\n• We pay on all benign brain tumours, and don’t insist on there being permanent neurological de cit\n If our critical illness de nitions improve, in most cases we’ll apply the improvements to their policies completely free of charge.

Typically, providers de ne the quality of their critical illness policies by the number of illnesses they cover.\nA few more areas where we’re challenging the norm:\nIs joint life best for clients? At Guardian, we offer dual life rather than joint life. You can still apply for 2 people at the same time, but we’ll give each client their own policy with their own cover – and we apply a multi-life discount. It means in the event of a claim, unlike a joint policy, the cover remains in place for the remaining partner. No one should lose their cover as well as their partner.\nWe don’t offer accelerated critical illness cover. At Guardian, we think if you claim on your critical illness cover, your life cover shouldn’t end. That’s why we don’t offer accelerated critical illness cover. Instead, we’ll automatically create 2 policies and apply a multi-product discount. Meaning your clients could have 2 payouts, rather than one.\nChildren’s critical illness cover as an optional extra. Typically, providers include children’s critical illness cover as part of the policy. At Guardian, our Children’s Critical Illness Protection is an optional extra that can be added to Life Protection or Critical Illness Protection. That means only those who have children are paying for this option.\nFracture Plus Protection as an optional extra. Fracture Plus Protection pays out up to £6,000 and covers speci ed fractures, dislocations, muscle ruptures and tears. You can add it to either Life Protection or Critical Illness Protection.\nWaiver of premium at no extra cost. At Guardian, we believe Premium Waiver is essential to providing the best cover. That’s why it comes as standard (at no extra cost), with no age or expiry limits. Plus,\nwe not only waive premiums if a client is too ill to work, we also waive them for 6 months after they have a baby or if they lose their job.\nWhen you need to guarantee a prompt payout. Writing a policy in trust is\noverly complex if you simply want to avoid probate. Our Payout Planner gets the money where it’s needed – fast.

Me too, but how often are we hearing it nowadays?\nPerhaps innovation in the protection sphere, and more notably in the income protection space recently, is removing the need for this type of parallel. Perhaps the fact that a lot\nof us don’t save anymore, treating ourselves\nto expensive and immediate purchases on a credit card is driving the realisation that we\ndo in fact need to protect our income. Is it because suddenly, customers now see the differences between Critical Illness and Income Protection (IP), and are recognising that they perform different functions in the way claims payments are assessed and paid, and what the cover actually protects?\nWhatever the reason, you have to agree that\nit is encouraging to see Income Protection going through a bit of a growth spurt at the moment. Webline, Synaptic’s protection portal, has enjoyed a 58% increase in IP quote requests when comparing Q3 2018 with the same period last year. In fact, during the last quarter alone, nearly 50% of all quote requests through Webline have been for IP, and this\nresurgence is being re ected right across the market.\nIf only it were that easy for an adviser to eulogise about how popular IP has become recently and get the customer to sign on the dotted line. Explaining some of the terms long- associated with IP will be one of the biggest\nchallenges – split deferred periods, short-term versus long-term, risk categories (or occupation classes), own, suited or any occupation, ADLs, and not to mention reassuring the customer that IP is not PPI. Putting PPI to one side, more complaints are received by the Ombudsman about the de nition of occupation used\nthan any other IP complaint. So why do IP policies continue to use these rather confusing expressions? If we swapped the current vernacular for more accessible and relevant words, perhaps some industry bodies wouldn’t need to promote a Jargon Buster or Glossary of terms section on their websites!\nIf you have been able to help the customer understand the mechanics of IP, it is ultimately the really positive work that providers are currently launching which makes the product real. Features being added to many policies are providing tangible bene ts to claimants. Think about the Rehabilitation services. There’s Day One cover (no waiting period, sorry I mean deferred period), especially relevant for the self-employed, and nowadays the ease with which a customer can apply along with\n                                                                                                                                                                                 ","      37\n                               Explaining some of the terms long-associated with IP will be one\nof the biggest challenges – split deferred periods, short-term versus long-term, risk categories (or occupation classes), own, suited or any occupation, ADLs, and not to mention reassuring the customer that IP is not PPI.\n the ability to have an underwriter directly help the customer with any tricky questions. That feature is particularly pertinent for any vulnerable customers taking an IP policy.\nWith that in mind, are we considering all segments of potential customers enough, particularly self-employed and vulnerable customers, and their ability to cope with understanding the intricacies of IP? Are they not bothering because of the perception that it is too complicated to understand or because they cannot afford it? The self-employed contribute more than £250bn to the UK economy, but still fail to save more than £50 a month. Many believe they are ineligible for IP.\nOr is it because many advisers steer away from the perceived complexity surrounding an IP product in certain situations?\nI was at a meeting recently where it was hot off the press that income from mortgage protection pay-outs would not affect people’s means-testing for State bene ts. What a fantastic start to making IP accessible to those deemed as being in a vulnerable position  nancially. But the challenge remains to make IP simple for advisers and customers alike.\nClaims payment statistics aren’t as attractive (87.2%) as IP’s cousins – Life (98.0%) and Critical Illness (92.2%) – but they are improving. However, claims paid rates shouldn’t be the only fact customers pay attention to when it comes to IP, perhaps\nas they do with other insurance products. It shouldn’t be about convincing the customer they need the cover, it is about helping the customer recognise the values in protecting their income before they should even start thinking about investments, and any other needs they think they may have. Surely,\nIP is the bedrock of any  nancial needs conversation. Isn’t it the very  rst  nancial product you should speak to your customers about? The General Public is not as  nancially resilient or savvy as it probably thinks it is, and the whole, “it won’t happen to me,” objection must be overcome and gradually withdrawn from circulation.\nSome customers may not also realise the employee bene ts they enjoy through the workplace, so they should be made aware that any potential loss in their income may\nnot be fully covered by their employer’s scheme. Likewise, the self-employed, must learn that for their business to continue producing the same income levels, they must consider IP as a crucial component to their  nancial planning. This replacement income must cover their lost earnings, so they can focus on their recovery without unnecessary distractions and get back to work as quickly as they can, and in a  t and healthy condition.\nFurthermore, whether the absence from work is accident or illness-related, advisers should be thinking about the possibility of their customer requiring a lengthy period away from their place of work. What if the customer has to think about treatment costs as well\nas managing their monthly commitments? Financial products offering ‘peace of mind’ shouldn’t be regarded as tugging on the heart strings but seen as an integral part of surviving a  nancially unknown future.\nSo, current statistics would indicate that the UK population is taking more notice of the cash dispenser in the corner of the room. We just need to make sure it is plugged in and serviced regularly so it’s ready to dish out those readies every month!\nWebline offers IP quotations from most of the top IP providers in the market. Following just a few simple inputs, IP quotes can be quickly obtained either as standalone products or as part of the multi-bene t service we provide.\nTo  nd out more visit www.synaptic. co.uk/research-tools/synaptic-webline- protection\n The self-employed contribute more than £250bn to the UK economy, but still fail to save more than £50 a month.

Or is it because many advisers steer away from the perceived complexity surrounding an IP product in certain situations?\n ","       38\n       What’s going on in Protection?\n  Jon Ford | Director of Individual Protection | Canada Life\nThe short answer is “a lot” but let’s get stuck into the long answer.\nInnovation and the customer experience are the order of the day. Modern life is getting faster, busier and more connected. The  rst two are pressures on our industry, but the third represents the opportunity for change. People don’t have the time or the inclination to spend hours  lling out forms or weeks waiting for underwriting decisions. With the help of technology, timescales can be dramatically reduced and the wider proposition can be made more relevant to the needs of the modern consumer. Ongoing evolution is vital if the UK’s protection gap, estimated at £2.4tn, is ever going to shrink.\nA huge amount of planning, experimenting and work has been going in to bringing\nthe protection purchasing journey into\nthe 21st century. One area of focus has been the underwriting process – the way in which medical information is gathered\nabout an applicant to determine how much their policy should cost. Historically, this can take a month or more but it is now possible to have cover in place in 20 to 30 minutes for 90% of people.\nThis is down to two main changes. The  rst is simplifying the language of medical questionnaires so they relate to the real-life experiences of the people taking them. For example, asking how many glasses of wine or pints of beer someone drinks in a week instead of  xating on the number of units, or tweaking a “lifelong non-smoker” to someone who has simply “never smoked”. These little changes may seem like mere quality of life adjustments on the surface, but making the  ow better, less repetitive and easier to read, questionnaires can be cut down by over 40% and still provide all the information an insurer needs. This improved journey,\nwith intuitive underwriting rules behind it, leads to over 80% of applicants getting their decision straight away, with the process taking around 20 minutes.\nLooking at that remaining 20%, there are still ways to limit the number of cases which need referral for a GP Report (GPR), a traditional underwriting road block. It takes, on average, more than 30 days to get a GPR back with suf cient information to make an underwriting decision, which is far longer than someone trying to buy life insurance wants to wait. It is also a lot of extra work for insurers – have you ever tried to read a GP’s handwriting?\n One area of focus has been the underwriting process – the way in which medical information is gathered about an applicant to determine how much their policy should cost. Historically, this can take a month or more but it is now possible to have cover in place in 20 to 30 minutes for 90% of people.\n ","39\n              People don’t have the time or the inclination to spend hours  lling out forms or weeks waiting for underwriting decisions. With the help of technology, timescales can be dramatically reduced and the wider proposition can be made more relevant to the needs of the modern consumer.\nIs it possible to obtain enough extra detail to make a decision about the applicant without putting them through the hassle of obtaining a GPR? For another 10% or so of customers, the answer is yes, by having an underwriter give them a call on the telephone, at a time when it is convenient for them. Underwriters have the knowledge and experience to ask carefully constructed questions which tease out\nthe critical details which allow them to make a decision there and then. This call typically takes around 10 minutes and will lead to a decision within 24 hours. 90% of customers have a price in front of them no more than a day after they  nished their application.\nRelevance is another key consideration. Life insurance is a tough sell, particularly to younger customers who can get cover for a song. Instead of the usual methods\nof trying to scare potential customers or, worse, rationally explain why protection insurance might be a good idea, long decades of failing to get through to this demographic have started to get insurers thinking that something different might be needed – such as giving them something they do want attached to an insurance product. Quality policies bring a wealth\nof information on personal care issues. Their advice and guidance on health and wellbeing, diet, exercise and lifestyle are conveniently packaged, giving customers\naccess to everything they need in their pocket. Magazine-style formats make  nding relevant articles easy in customers’ day-to-day lives.\nThe switch for many from physical, industrial jobs to desk-bound, screen-based working has shifted the risk factors in our working lives. The risk of physical strain or accident has given way to mental strain and fatigue. Feeling we’re always on the\ngo and required to be contactable 24/7 is taking its toll on our mental health.\nStress and mental health feature in the top  ve reasons for absence in the UK in 2016. 37% of stress and mental health issues stem from problems in our personal lives.\nThe implications are clear. Mental health issues:\n• can make it harder to concentrate\n• may cause us to take longer doing tasks\nor making decisions\n• can reduce our patience when dealing\nwith others\nInstead of taking the lifeguard approach and rushing in to save people from drowning, we should be ‘teaching them\nto swim’ to help them avoid getting into trouble in the  rst place. Support services focused on health and lifestyle, along with responsible employment policies, can do just that.\nThat is a sample of the innovation and progress being made in the Individual Protection arena. Customer-focused product design and processes should continue to make it increasingly easy to make this purchase which is, ultimately, made with the head rather than the heart.\nFor more information on how Individual Protection is changing, please get in touch with Canada Life at ipp.admin@canadalife.co.uk\n The switch for many from physical, industrial jobs to desk-bound, screen-based working has shifted the risk factors in our working lives.

Because of the various moving parts, gaining a single view of the problem is surprisingly dif cult.\nMany adviser  rms are reluctant to tinker with advice formulas that they have embedded in their business, even though in some cases, the process is a mishmash of tools and assumptions that are long past their sell-by date. A risk being run\nis that the use of an Attitude to Risk Questionnaire (ATRQ) which they borrowed or downloaded 10 years ago, may have no research proving its correct alignment to an investment strategy. Similarly they may not have access to a measure for risk that they can apply across different investments and investment styles.\nWe would urge  rms to consider the ground that is being prepared for future scrutiny and enforcement. A paper (TR16/1) was published in 2016 that established the central role of ‘research’ in the provision\nof compliant advice, and that poor advice was the result of ‘poor research and due diligence’. The paper identi ed a culture in many  rms that lacked ‘challenge’ and on-going reassessment. It highlighted an over-reliance on providers (particularly\nin context of platform selection), and\ncriticised failure in  rms to understand their ‘own inappropriate bias towards products, services or providers’.\nThis theme has reappeared in multiple thematic reviews, and  nds its full expression in the new MiFID II directives that seek to strong-arm advisers into additional due diligence to promote\nthe interest of consumers. However, as several of our customers have pointed out, the more obvious headlines that have occupied compliance departments (such as disclosure of transaction costs, and the requirement of full proof of suitability\nat review) have obscured the further considerations posed by PROD (Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook), even more directives that originate from the FCA and designed\nto ensure.. implementation of MiFID II.. hurrah!\nPROD in fact requires  rms to act as providers by insisting a  rm’s C.I.P. assumes some of the same responsibilities as a manufacturer. A nightmare if executed poorly, but if this initiative does succeed\nin aligning manufacturers, distributors\nand consumers it could be very powerful. The best outcome would be to see  rms soaring through the red tape and greatly improving the quality of their advice.\nThat means that  rms will need to\nhave performed segmentation, and designed solutions that are appropriate\nfor different tranches of clients. Target market disclosures are obligatory for all providers. In our parlance, this requires the building and maintaining of a C.I.P. based on segmentation, and performing due diligence (preferably independent of any provider) to demonstrate suitability. The emphasis in the paper is on performance of regular reviews to ensure compliance with the directives. The need for strict product governance becomes non- negotiable. When it comes to personal recommendations,  rms obviously need to be able to demonstrate that the generic model represented by the C.I.P. maintains suitability at the level of recommendation.\nThe PROD sourcebook summarises a  rm’s (distributor’s) responsibilities:\n(1) disclosure(seeCOBS4andCOBS14.3A); (2) suitability (see COBS 9A);\n(3) appropriateness (see COBS 10A);\n(4) inducements (see COBS 2.3A); and\n(5) con ict of interest (see SYSC 10.1).\n ","     41\n                          Firms will need to have performed segmentation, and designed solutions that are appropriate for different tranches of clients.

In our parlance, this requires the building and maintaining of a C.I.P. based on segmentation, and performing due diligence (preferably independent of any provider) to demonstrate suitability.\nA quick survey of these requirements should be enough to prove that the FCA is very serious about ratcheting up the compliance responsibility of  rms.\nWhich brings us to today’s challenge: how to de ne an investment strategy that will help de ne the range of risk in a C.I.P and provide on-going proof of suitability regarding risk. What do we do?\nA positive consensus is forming around the role of stochastic forecasting in the building an investment strategy. This assumes that the model in question has proven itself over the years (not all have). Moody’s Analytics (formerly Barrie + Hibbert) are considered to be the leaders in this  eld.\nBy x-raying any investment, taking the asset allocation and applying forward looking projections for said investments, we can build a picture of the likely investment trajectory based on probability. Building your ef cient frontier using the ‘Value at Risk’ measure, and other metrics produced by a stochastic model, is a better approach than working to a volatility based model. This is because stochastic forecasts can capture the investment trend, and forecasting ‘viable’ outcomes is increasingly proven to be more successful than reliance on volatility.\nCrucially a stochastic approach gives\nyou a range of values which you can use\nto discuss loss with your client. You can reasonably forecast the extent of losses in a bad year (the min gain), you can adopt a reliable growth assumption (the ave gain) and you can use the pro le to demonstrate the asymmetric risk and reward ratio that drives long term investment gain.\n  ","Unlike competitors who have developed a culture of ‘set and forget’, Synaptic reviews asset allocations, projections and risk ratings every quarter so you can ful l your duty to monitor risk exposure on behalf of the client.\nThe stochastic model\nMathematically captures the full range of ‘viable’ outcomes for an investment strategy, by identifying the different asset classes in the allocation and projecting their possible growth trajectories.\nThe ef cient frontier\nThousands of portfolio variants are tested to decide on best asset allocations to form our Strategic Asset Allocations. Each quarter these SAAs are rerun through the model to test\nthe boundaries between the risk categories. Thereafter, any investment can be mapped to the model, to create a consistent view of risk, that is always current.\nThe Synaptic Risk pro le\nThe risk and return dynamics of the Quilter MPS portfolios (in my C.I.P.)\n This consists of min gain / ave gain / max gain. Perfectly captures the asymmetry of investment returns in favour of investor over the long term, and quanti es losses and likely gains along the way. The min gain value is the Value at Risk measure that is used to quantify likely losses in a bad year (1 in 20), to agree Capacity for Loss parameters with a client in a meaningful way.\nTactical vs Strategic\nVery useful for advice where the strategic allocation can be used, but also allows for a manager’s ‘tilts’ to be monitored.\nWe are often asked to supply a simple explanation of how our research process supports advice in the context of risk. Alas, no such simple guide exists, so this is my attempt at an overview. Key take away is the use of ‘Value at Risk’ (loss in portfolio in bad year, de ned as 1 in 20), as opposed to Volatility banding.\nSynaptic Risk is FREE.

Otherwise Synaptic Risk Ratings assume a 10 year investment horizon. You should consult Royal London directly for further information before recommending.\nAbout the service: Synaptic Risk Ratings are worked out by analysing the underlying asset classes within the fund or portfolio. Synaptic Software have requested asset allocation information from participating providers in a specific format aligned to the risk framework of the system. These asset classes are used by the model to determine the risk rating, a process that may result in a level of approximation though in most cases this will be insignificant.
