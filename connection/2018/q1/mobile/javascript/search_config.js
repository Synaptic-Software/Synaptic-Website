There seems to be a draconian element to regulation that was exported from the UK to the continent to come back as such a fearsome package. More on this inside.\nIt seems that advisers are expected to overstate the reasons why a client might not want to engage an adviser; ‘regulation says\nI can’t be trusted, so I need to make every effort to dissuade you from employing me. If you’re still here at the end of the process then it’s your look out’. Baking in rules such as the 10% loss noti cation seems like a sensible check and balance, but will surely unsettle the otherwise sensibly invested.\nThe regulator should use the trust that customers give to their advisers as a starting point and work to expand access, rather than to encourage a ghetto of advice accessible only to the wealthy.\nThe MiFID requirements to provide additional 'ex-ante' and 'ex-post' analysis will increase the amount of due diligence undertaken and increase the value of sound research.\nSynaptic is working to ensure that the best data and analysis is available to advisers to continue to do the great job they do, and make the best investment decisions without undue fear of falling short of compliance audit.\nAs our Risk Ratings service grows at a pace, we are able to welcome the views of several new providers into these pages, offering more great insights that could help maintain the quality of those investment decisions.

We see this as a broad trend, most obvious in the US, but also prevalent across Europe, Japan and emerging markets.\nValue investing has a long-term track record – championed by the likes of Benjamin Graham back in the 1930s and Warren Buffett – but followers of this strategy have suffered a lost decade since the end of the  nancial crisis.\nAs a contrarian approach by nature, value often endures dif cult periods, most notably during the tech bubble of the late 1990s. But the current malaise has been so prolonged that Goldman Sachs’ research\nrecently debated whether value investing is effectively dead.\nThankfully, for its many followers around the world, the investment bank concluded it is too early to give up on value and current ‘unfriendly’ conditions are unlikely to persist.\nElsewhere, renowned US hedge fund manager David Einhorn from Greenlight Capital, another value acolyte, has also contemplated in recent months whether his favoured strategy might never return to favour.\nWriting to investors in October, Einhorn stressed his view that the value cycle will turn ‘when it turns’ but also considered an alternative option in which the market has adopted an alternative paradigm.\n“What if equity value has nothing to do with current or future pro ts and instead is derived from a company’s ability to be disruptive, to provide social change or\nto advance new bene cial technologies, even when doing so results in current and future economic loss?” he asked. Anyone watching the rise of Facebook and friends in recent years would admit this has often seemed the case.\nFor our part, we point to several signals\nas to why 2018 may be a good time to increase exposure to the cheaper value end of the market. But as many commentators, including us, were also talking up the opportunity at the start of 2017, investors can justi ably ask what is different now.\nStrong performance from growth stocks since the  nancial crisis is understandable, with investors willing to pay for companies able to outgrow a sluggish global economy. According to Goldmans, ongoing ‘secular stagnation’ has clearly inspired investors to favour stocks capable of generating their own growth over value names.\nThis has supported the FANG companies (Facebook, Amazon, Net ix and Google) and many others, whereas  nancial stocks – a bastion of value as much as technology\n Thankfully, for its many followers around the world, the investment bank concluded it is too early to give up on value and current ‘unfriendly’ conditions are unlikely to persist.\n "," 5\n  We continue to look to buy favoured areas when they are cheap and have recently tilted our multi-asset portfolios towards value stocks, where performance remains far below surging growth companies.\nis of growth – have spent the last decade weighed down by ever-increasing regulation.\nValue began to rally in 2016 and into 2017 after central banks appeared to be stepping away from austerity, realising monetary stimulus had reached the end of the road and governments needed to stimulate economic growth. This recovery faltered however as President Trump’s earlier policy initiatives – including healthcare reform – stalled and little progress was apparent in areas such as infrastructure.\nParticularly in the US, the gap between growth and value has now reached historic levels and we see a solid case for this starting to unwind in the shape of Trump’s tax cuts. Wherever you stand on these politically, consensus suggests the positives for corporations and individuals could boost many sectors of the economy in 2018 and if Trump continues his deregulation plans,  nancials look to be an obvious bene ciary.\nValue stocks tend to outperform when economic expansion is broad-based and relatively robust – generally at the start of a cycle – and there are signs we may be coming out of the sluggish growth of recent years.\nWe are currently in a rare situation in terms of the global economy, with all 45 countries tracked by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on pace to register growth in 2017\nsince 2010, when many enjoyed a  eeting bounce from the global  nancial crisis.\nIn the past 50 years, such simultaneous growth has been rare: apart from 2007, it only happened in the late 1980s and for a few years before the 1973 oil crisis.\nSomething else to bear in mind is that high- ying growth stocks have posted earnings that do not necessarily match their expensive valuations and, at some point, investors will want to see a closer relationship between the two. Whispers\nof another tech bubble remain muted for now but in an environment where earnings matter more than future prospects, value names come to the fore.\nA  nal driver for value is the relative downside protection these fundamentally cheap stocks can offer after a decade out of favour. While no one is ever keen for a downturn, we were not surprised to see the February correction in markets. We are not expecting a prolonged bear period, which is typically preceded by economic recession, but given their strong run, growth stocks will likely bear the brunt of any selloffs and we are watching current events with interest.\n High- ying growth stocks have posted earnings that do not necessarily match their expensive valuations and,\nat some point, investors will want to see a closer relationship between the two.\n( nal  gures will be released in due course) and 33 of these accelerating from 2016.\nThis is the  rst time since 2007 that all of these countries are growing in sync and the most countries in acceleration\n ","  6\n  Multi-Asset view:\nwhy focus on income?\n Dean Cheeseman & Nick Watson | Fund Managers | Janus Henderson Investors\n Dean Cheeseman and Nick Watson, fund managers with Janus Henderson’s UK-based Multi-Asset Team, discuss why focusing on income could be a bene cial strategy for longer- term capital returns.\nHistorical data shows that dividend\nyield and dividend growth have been the strongest drivers of equity returns over the long-term. The chart opposite illustrates just how in uential income has been across a number of developed markets over a 45+ year time period.\nChart 1: Dividend yield has driven long-term equity returns\nQ. Why has focusing on income driven returns?\nThere are a number of reasons why income investing within equities has been an advantageous strategy over a long-term period:\ni) Identifying well-managed and pro table businesses\nFor income to be relevant it must be generated from a company’s net operating pro ts. A policy of raising debt to pay shareholders is typically unsustainable and weakens the overall business. Returning a regular and ideally growing income is a sign of a healthy cash-generative business. The discipline of returning cash to shareholders is also a sign of good stewardship by management and often robust governance.\nDividends are paid in ‘physical’ cash from earnings or retained earnings and cannot be manipulated by accounting techniques. These characteristics of pro table and well-managed businesses can also be described as ‘quality’ factors/premia and academic research has shown ‘quality’ to be a long-term driver of excess returns.\nii) Sustainable income has tended to lead to greater stability of returns\nCompanies that distribute a sustainable income tend to generate repeatable cash  ows, which are likely to lead to greater asymmetry in returns (i.e. more likely to produce a positive skew). Generating a\n Source: Thomson Reuters Datastream, Janus Henderson, and Société Génerale Cross Asset Research, quarterly data from 1970 to Q2 2017, rolling ten-year average real (in ation-adjusted) returns. Multiple expansion relates to rising price-earnings multiples. Please note that past performance is not a guide to future performance.\n ","7\n   Generating a sustainable income is highly correlated with a business being well-managed and pro table. The ability to generate stable returns and offer greater resilience to market volatility should also make that business easier to forecast.\nsustainable income is highly correlated with a business being well-managed and pro table. The ability to generate stable returns and offer greater resilience to market volatility should also make that business easier to forecast.\niii) Income investing can offer a hedge against in ation over the longer term Whilst equities per se can offer in ation protection over the longer term, the growth of dividends paid generally outpaces the in ation rate. Unlike shorter-term in ation hedges,\ni.e. in ation-linked bonds that are poor performers if the in ation risk being hedged fails to materialise, equities that pay out a sustainable income should capture much\nof the market upside when in ation is less prevalent, and may outperform when in ation becomes more persistent.\niv) Bene ts from pound cost averaging\nIn a falling equity market, thanks to the reinvested dividends being added at lower capital levels, the average purchase cost for the investment is reduced. Typically, in an economic downturn, dividend paying companies will continue to return cash to shareholders, even after corporate earnings start to fall.\nv) Income investing can identify companies that have value characteristics\nCompanies that distribute a steady income\nto shareholders often trade at a discount to the broader market, because of a number of fundamental and behavioural reasons. Cash  ow positive businesses are generally mature and ‘ex-growth’, whereas the market assigns\na premium to faster growing companies. The market also often underestimates the bene ts\nof the long-term compounding generated by steady income by focusing too much on the shorter-term growth outlook.\nQ. What about income investing in the short term versus the longer term?\nOver a longer time frame, the key in uence to a market’s price-to-earnings (PE) ratio\nis in ation, and the key  nancial metric associated with in ation is the long-term interest rate. PE ratios are inversely correlated with interest rates, falling when rates rise and rising when rates fall. Currently, we are seeing stretched PE ratios and record low interest rates, largely as a result of QE. But looking forward, the US and UK have now moved into an interest rate tightening phase (albeit very gradual), which should see PE ratios begin to moderate. Over the shorter term, if equity markets are going to deliver positive returns, it is likely that this will be driven by dividends rather than PE expansion.\nFor the latest insights from the managers of the Core Multi-Asset Solutions range, together with useful educational material, please visit: www.janushenderson.com/core-multi-asset Email us at sales.support@janushenderson.com Call us on 0207 818 2839\nImportant information:\nThis document is intended solely for the\nuse of professionals, de ned as Eligible Counterparties or Professional Clients, and is not for general public distribution.\nPast performance is not a guide to future\nperformance.

Launched in September 2010, the Standard Life Investments MyFolio range has been a popular solution for advisers looking to outsource for a number of reasons.\nClearly, with a variety of client objectives, many advisers are looking for a solution that also offers them choice and  exibility. With 25 different funds, the risk-rated MyFolio contains  ve different risk levels (from one (lowest risk) to  ve (highest risk)) and  ve different investment ranges. The Market range invests mainly in passive funds, and is the lowest cost option, and the Managed and Managed Income ranges invest predominantly in Standard Life Investments funds.\nMeanwhile, the Multi-Manager and Multi- Manager Income ranges both invest in funds from best-in-class fund managers across the whole market.\nIn addition, the MyFolio range can invest in up to 21 different asset classes, with the aim of allowing investors access to a truly diversi ed, actively managed portfolio.\nWe manage each of the 25 funds using a robust and repeatable four-step process. The  rst step is working in consultation with Moody’s Analytics, world-leading experts in risk-modelling, to help determine the most ef cient strategic\nmix of assets for each fund. Step two is  ne-tuning this long-term Strategic Asset Allocation to take advantage of shorter- term investment opportunities we have identi ed (Tactical Asset Allocation). Next, we select the optimal blend of individual funds that go into each MyFolio fund, using quantitative and qualitative analysis. The  nal step is to regularly review and rebalance the portfolios, to check that each fund is always on track to deliver as expected.\nThen there is the vast resource behind MyFolio. Our investment process draws upon the expertise of more than 60 investment professionals, including economists, fund analysts, asset class experts and one of the largest dedicated fund research teams in the UK, led by fund manager Bambos Hambi. Expertise\n We manage each of the 25 funds using a robust and repeatable four-step process.

This comprehensive investment process allows advisers to outsource investment management to a team of dedicated experts whose day-to- day job is looking after clients’ investments which is a key bene t of MyFolio.\nFor  nancial advisers, it is also critical\nthat clients are provided with a solution matching their willingness and ability to take risk. Therefore, we designed MyFolio to help advisers achieve the right balance between risk and reward for clients. Moreover, key to MyFolio’s success over the past seven years has been that each\nof the funds has delivered risk-adjusted returns in line with expectations. Investors in higher risk levels have experienced more volatility but have been compensated through higher long-term returns than the lower risk levels.\nWe also believe full transparency on MyFolio aids advisers and investors in understanding the funds. As a result, there is a range of resources, including client- friendly literature, regular webcasts and written updates on the funds available\nfor advisers. A MyFolio reporting tool also means advisers can create branded client reports with market and fund commentary – yet another reason MyFolio has proven so popular.\nUltimately, we launched MyFolio in 2010 in response to demand from advisers for cost-effective, risk-targeted solutions.\nThe aim was to provide a solution that supported advisers and delivered excellent risk-adjusted returns for clients. Over the last seven years, the MyFolio funds have behaved, without exception, in line with investors’ chosen level of risk.\nIn order to ensure we continue to act in the best interest of investors, we regularly review the MyFolio funds. At the latest review, we made an adjustment to the pricing structure, reducing the annual management charge for multiple share classes across the MyFolio OEIC range. Reducing the charges further enhances MyFolio’s position as a market-leading risk-based, fund-of-funds proposition.\nNow trusted with over £13 billion in assets under management (as at December 2017), the team behind MyFolio seek to continue delivering the long-term performance and support that advisers and their clients\nlook for in an ideal, risk-rated investment solution.\nDiscover more about MyFolio at\nwww.standardlifeinvestments.com/ myfolio\nAberdeen Standard Investments is a brand of the investment businesses of Aberdeen Asset Management and Standard Life Investments.\nThe value of an investment is not guaranteed and can go down as well as up.

With the array of new regulation, including MiFID II and the impending GDPR, set against the backdrop of economic uncertainty and changing client needs, there is much with which advisers need to get to grips.\nWith all this change and uncertainty, sometimes all we want is a little normality. Reassurance that some things can be reliable, despite everything else that’s going on around them.\nAt Verbatim, that’s exactly what we provide. Since our launch in 2010, we have had one simple philosophy; to deliver in line with client expectations. Now, that may seem like a sweeping statement, but that’s exactly what we do. Our mandate is simple; to provide investment solutions that are run to proven risk-managed mandates. And we’ve been doing that without fail ever since.\nAt Verbatim, we start with a plan and we, well - deliver to that plan. We set clear and concise goals, which are measurable and\nfor which we are accountable. This in turn means that you can provide your clients with that little bit of reassurance in an otherwise unpredictable world.\nSo, how does it work?\nVerbatim Asset Management provides market-leading risk managed investment solutions. We offer a range of active and passive multi-asset funds, managed model portfolios and a unique discretionary management service. All of which are overseen by our Independent Investment Committee, who provide governance, oversight and monitoring for all of our solutions.\nFP Verbatim Portfolio (Growth) Funds\nOur  agship active fund range is one of the longest established and most successful risk-managed, multi-asset solutions in the marketplace. Launched in 2010, the fund range has consistently performed within the parameters of each given risk pro le.\nThe funds are run on an unfettered basis, with an active management overlay. The mandate enables the fund managers to be\nover or underweight by 3% in any given asset class.\nEach of the  ve funds has been awarded a Lipper Leader rating and/or a Morningstar 5* rating for performance. In 2016, RSMR, one of the leading fund research agencies, accredited the FP Verbatim Portfolio (Growth) Fund range an RSMR Rated Fund Range Status.\nJohn Husselbee and Paul Kim are the managers selected to run the FP Verbatim Portfolio (Growth) Funds and are two of the most high-pro le multi-asset managers in the industry, with 62 years of combined investment experience.\nFP Verbatim Fund (Income)\nOur income fund is a multi-asset, unfettered fund that aims to deliver a 4% target annual yield, preserve capital invested and provide some capital growth over the medium to long-term.\n ","          11\n                                                                                     With all this change and uncertainty, sometimes all we want is a little normality. Reassurance that some things can be reliable, despite everything else that’s going on around them.\nThe fund utilises a combination of global direct equities and  xed income to meet the target yield. As part of the investment selection process, the fund managers screen the global equity markets with a thematic investment approach, to identify stocks that will produce sustainable long-term dividend income.\nImplementing a global income strategy creates real diversi cation across the fund. This can potentially deliver higher yields and higher dividend income, along with achieving total return over the medium to long-term.\nVerbatim Total Clarity\nOur passive fund range, Total Clarity, consists of four established multi-index, risk-managed funds, but with a difference. The funds are run on an unfettered basis, with an active management overlay. The mandate enables the fund managers to be over or underweight by 3% in any given asset class. Combining passive with active management decisions provides an excellent cost-effective solution to maximise potential returns.\nEach of the four funds has been awarded a Lipper Leader Rating over both three and  ve year periods, demonstrating consistency in performance and the management of the funds to the proven risk mandates.\nManaged Model Portfolios\nOur managed model portfolio service was launched in 2016, to meet the increasing demands of advisers to provide a managed investment service to their clients.\nWe conducted a thorough due diligence process to identify the correct partners to run the Managed Model Portfolios and following this process, we partnered with two of the market leading fund research agencies, RSMR and Square Mile.\nA choice of growth, income and capital preservation portfolios are available, all running to our proven risk mandates and managed for a market leading rate of 0.25% + VAT.\nThe portfolios are available via some\nof the leading platforms, making them accessible for many advisers. The portfolios are automatically rebalanced, meaning no administrative headaches for you or your clients. We provide regular performance updates, allowing you to monitor both suitability and that they are meeting your clients’ expectations.\nDiscretionary Service\nOur platform provides access to  ve different investment managers, each providing a different style of investment management.\nOffering an array of different managers, allows you to choose which strategy best meets your client’s needs. Clients can switch portfolios easily and swiftly, at no cost, providing unrivalled  exibility.\nVerbatim Asset Management has created bespoke composite benchmarks for each of the strategic asset allocations, allowing the investment manager to demonstrate precisely how they have performed.\nIndependent Investment Committee\nOur independent investment committee meets regularly to perform reviews on the selected fund managers, to ensure that\nthey continue to adhere to their aims and objectives. They will ratify the strategic\nasset allocation along with any adjustments made to the model and any amendments are discussed with each fund manager, before being implemented.\nTime for a closer look?\nNow that you are a little more familiar with Verbatim, it may be the perfect time to take\na closer look at how we could help you meet client expectations when it comes to investing.\nFor more information, please email info@verbatim-am.co.uk or contact the helpdesk on 0808 124 0007\n ","  12\n            Dicing with Pricing: an eventful year\n Steve Nelson | Head of research | the lang cat\nThe thing I’m known most for at the lang cat, other than bad jokes, are our pricing tables. Presented in glorious technicolour (and absolutely not just a rudimentary feature of Microsoft Excel. Oh no.) these tables allow you to have a gander at platform pricing at a market level and get a quick sense of who is competitive at various portfolio levels. We’ll get right in about that shortly.\nWhat’s new pussycat?\nBut  rst, 2017 was a funny old year in platform pricing. After a couple of fallow years, you could have been excused for thinking that pricing was starting to really settle. And then a swathe of changes started to  lter through, almost as if we’d angered the arithmetic Gods. Here’s a lowdown of some of the highlights of last year.\n• Transact continues to shave bits and bobs off its core charges following another\nyear of pro tability. Back in April, its core pricing tier of 0.31% was reduced to 0.30%. It’s doing similar again this coming April, reducing again down to 0.29%. If this trend continues, Transact will be paying you to use it come 2046. #maths. Joking aside, this is one of those instances where the philosophy is more important than\na single basis point. Transact has been doing this for an age now and it’s a great position to be in.\n• Ploughing a similar furrow, Nucleus also made a shaving to its platform structure, reducing the charge applying to portfolios over £500k. The average holding on Nucleus is some way below this (as is that for most of the rest of the market, mind you) so\nwe see this as more of a strategic push for\nchunkier pot values.\n• Squeezing into the update by the width of a\ngnat’s unmentionables at ten to Hogmanay was Zurich Intermediary Platform, which made a couple of cuts to portfolios of more than £250k, a move intended to attract larger pots, pension in particular.\n• Moving on to the two most signi cant changes. First up, James Hay completely overhauled its Modular iPlan structure with some pricing hokey cokey. Some charges went up a bit, some down a bit and some stayed much of a muchness. Overall, most customers are worse off by around 6 or 7 basis points, a move deemed necessary by James Hay in order to invest further in the business. A delicate message to convey to\nthe market, but we were heartened by the\nresponse (or lack thereof).\n• The most pleasing change of all to a nerd\nlike me was the move by Ascentric to a simple, fully inclusive structure that includes all dealing irrespective of investment type. It’s a move that echoes one of the original intentions of the brave new world of platforms. A neutral-priced environment, regardless of tax wrapper and investment type. We like.\n• Perhaps the biggest news of all came in the guise of the two new entrants to the platform market. Step forward Embark and Hubwise...say hello to your mothers, tell us a bit about yourselves and where you come from. Sorry. Yes.

And then a swathe of changes started to  lter through, almost as if we’d angered the arithmetic Gods.\nEnough with the chatter, show me the pretty colours\nFor our (in)famous heatmaps, we use a sample wrapper split of 50% pension, 25% ISA and 25% GIA. Clearly this can and does vary signi cantly from client to client but, based on our analysis of the market, this is a decent representative split at aggregate level.\nWe’re also assuming investment in a model portfolio that is made up of ten equal fund holdings (around 94% of platform assets are in collectives and cash) that rebalances quarterly to correct a 2% drift. Your driftage may vary.\nMashing that all together gives us ongoing annual costs that look like this.\n  ","  14\n           If you’re an adviser conducting a platform selection process, then be open and honest about your  ow levels and ask for\na deal. In the last year or so we helped manage selection exercises for well over £500m AUA and we know that there are cuts out there if you ask for them.\nOoh, that looks lovely, but what does it all mean?\n• Around 35 basis points or thereabouts continues to be the watermark for ongoing platform custody at the core market level. And by that we mean portfolios around the £100k to £200k mark (we place the mode pot size in the market to be a shade under £150k).\n• Platforms tend to be competitive at different segments. There are a handful\nof platforms who dominate at the higher end, with the price caps from Aegon Retirement Choices, Hubwise (and\nAJ Bell Investcentre to a lesser extent) and the ultra-low custody charge from James Hay and Embark joining fixed-fee nonconformists Alliance Trust Savings in the green zone.\n• Embark and Hubwise make a mockery ofthe notion of market averages by killing it pretty much across the board, clearly feeling at their respective HQs that (1) they will have to be competitive as a new entrant\nand (2) they feel they have the propositions\nto deliver it at a profit. We wish them well.\n• Despite the rumours you might have heard,\nsize really doesn’t matter. Stop it. You’ll hear chat from some quarters that the only way platforms will be able to deliver profit and lower charges for the customer is by achieving scale. That’s fine and dandy in an economic textbook but it’s simply not true (yet) of the sector. As we’ve seen, some of the smaller platforms dominate on price. Similarly, some of the more modestly sized in terms of flows are also the most profitable.\n• One important point to note is that\nthese are shop window prices. If you’re an adviser conducting a platform selection process, then be open and honest about your flow levels and ask for a deal.

By the time you read this, there’s a good chance something will have come along to change a couple of lines in the table. Such is life.

Over the last 20 years, income has accounted for 90% of total returns from major asset classes. In some cases, it has accounted for more than 100% of returns with asset classes such as high yield debt seeing capital value erosion after income. In the short-term, the predictability of an asset’s income stream may seem high.\nTypically companies set days for the declaration and payment of dividends, while coupon bearing bonds have a schedule of payments. Investors, however, should focus on the enormous variability of longer-term income sustainability between and within asset classes and the capital risks which can dwarf the bene ts of the income received. Here we describe some of the commonly available sources of income, the risks associated with them, and how to combine them for a robust income stream.\nA reliance on ‘natural income’\nThe Investec Diversi ed Income Fund has achieved its three objectives of defensive returns, an attractive and sustainable yield, and volatility less than half that of UK equities by focusing primarily on ‘natural income’. Selling options is one method that can occasionally be an attractive means of generating synthetic income, however, we do not think it is wise to employ it throughout the cycle. Call overwriting works by selling call options in exchange for a ‘premium’. This entitles the purchaser of the option to buy the underlying asset from the option seller should its price rise to the ‘strike’ (the exercise price).\nThe amount of ‘premium’ generated is dependent on factors such as the distance between that strike price and where the asset currently trades, the amount of time left until the option expiration and the asset’s volatility. The last of these is a key reason why we don’t think this source of synthetic income should be relied on throughout the cycle.\nThere are points in time when the risk/reward pro le of selling an option may be attractive, for example if volatility looks excessively high. However, to engage in options selling simply for income generation risks exposing the investor to capital losses that exceed\ngains (particularly if offsetting assets are not owned or if they perform poorly). As a result, this strategy should be approached with caution and with an awareness of the cyclical environment.\nGrowth, Defensive and Uncorrelated income streams\nInvestec’s Multi-Asset team categorises assets according to their behaviour relative to the cycle. An asset can be Growth, Defensive\nand Uncorrelated (Figure 1) and this applies equally when we think of income streams.\n Over the last 20 years, income has accounted for 90% of total returns from major asset classes. In some cases, it has accounted for more than 100% of returns.\n "," 17\n  Whether investors seek yield primarily for cash ow requirements or for use as a component of total return, the dependability of the income streams from, and the capital\nrisks associated with the assets they buy matters.\nBLENDING DIFFERENT TYPES OF INCOME CAN ACHIEVE TRUE DIVERSIFICATION\nFigure 1: Behaviours matter more than asset labels\nSource: Investec Asset Management\nFigure 2 shows that while the volatility and yield (the size of the circle) varies considerably by behaviours (Growth, Defensive and Uncorrelated) they are relatively close in terms of their signi cant proportion of total returns explained by income.\nIdentifying, understanding and blending sources of income\nWe focus on having a clear and repeatable process when building the Diversi ed Income Fund as we seek to ensure a dependable\nand compelling level of income. The process involves:\n• Selecting assets from the bottom-up and from a variety of asset classes by undertaking a thorough analysis of the cash ow streams of corporations and governments, and the accompanying risks to capital.\n• Understand the likely behaviours of selected assets, and holding a diversity of Growth, Defensive and Uncorrelated assets.\n• Hedging drawdown risks by using the holistic understanding of the portfolio from the bottom-up and top-down to ef ciently protect against losses.\nThe result of this process is a diversi ed series of contributors to the Fund’s distribution yield.\nTo read the full article and for more insights, visit\nwww.investecassetmanagement.com/DIF\n Growth\n Returns in line with expectations of real economic growth i.e. react positively to increasing risk appetite\n• Equities\n• High yield debt\n• Emerging market debt and currency • FX carry\n• Property\n• Private equity\n Defensive\n Returns are positive when expectations of real economic growth are decliing i.e. safe havens in market crises\n• Government bonds\n• Index-linked bonds\n• Investment grade bonds • Shorting growth\n• FX\n Uncorrelated\n Returns are generally unrelated to real economic and corporate earnings growth i.e variable relationship with growth\n• Infrastructure • Insurance\n• Relative value\nFigure 2: Income characteristics of asset classes versus behaviours\n18 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0\nEM LC debt\nDefensive\n   Uncorrelated\nHigh yield debt - global\nInvestement grade debt\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 Proportion of returns from income (%)\n  Global equities\nGrowth\n      Global property\n DM gov't debt\n Source: Morningstar, Bloomberg, BofA Merrill Lynch, Investec Asset Management, in USD, 30.09.17.

Typically that estimate is derived by applying what we think is a fair multiple to our expected earnings for a company in three years’ time. Often, however, we use free cash  ow (FCF) instead of earnings, and apply a fair free cash  ow yield to derive our fair value.\nEarnings do not tell the full story\nAs investors, we broadly accept that earnings are a good starting point but they do not tell the full story. It can be helpful when analysing certain types of companies to also examine FCF and balance sheet strength, particularly in the case of capital intensive businesses where the equity owners can be asked at various\nstages to help fund new asset purchases.\nFCF analysis led to the purchase of holdings: JD.com, Mediatek, Asustek and Samsung Electronics\nA great example of a stock where we used FCF to drive our valuation estimate is JD.com, one of our top  ve holdings in the Invesco Perpetual Asian Fund. JD.com is the ‘Amazon of China’ and competes with Alibaba. FCF is materially higher than earnings for JD.com\nas their customers pay them sooner than they pay their suppliers. Despite a net loss in accounting terms over the last reported 12 month period, the company’s free cash  ow has been signi cantly positive to the tune of US$4.3bn which puts the stock on a FCF yield of 7%. In our opinion, this is a reasonable FCF\nyield for a company with little or no growth prospects, but for a company like JD.com which is growing revenue at 40% per annum, it is very attractive.\nAnother tool we use in addition to the straight FCF yield is the “FCF to enterprise value”.\nThis is in many ways a superior metric to\nthe straight FCF yield because it highlights those companies with substantial cash on their balance sheets which a simple P/E ratio or even a FCF yield would fail to capture. For example, we invested in a leading Taiwanese semiconductor design company, Mediatek, which had approximately 40% of its market value in cash. This placed it on a FCF/ EV of over 10% which led us to conclude that this company was undervalued given its strong growth outlook in 2018 and 2019. In some cases, the fair value multiple we apply to derive our fair valuation estimate is adjusted depending on the strength of the balance sheet. A good example of a stock where we made such an adjustment is when we decided to invest in Asustek, a Taiwanese motherboard manufacturer, which has a substantial amount of cash on its balance sheet (approximately equal to 80% of its market capitalisation).\nLarge cash balances can be returned to shareholders in the form of dividends or share\n As investors, we broadly accept that earnings are a good starting point but they do not tell the full story. It can be helpful when analysing certain types of companies to also examine FCF and balance sheet strength, particularly in the case of capital intensive businesses where the equity owners can be asked at various stages to help fund new asset purchases.\n "," 19\n                  We rather take the risk of buying what we believe are undervalued stocks with limited downside, rather than buy stocks where there is a material risk of a de-rating, leading potentially to an investment declining in absolute terms.\nbuybacks. Companies such as Microsoft and Apple have over recent years been under pressure from investors to return cash to shareholders and, as a result, have made commitments to do so which have help their share price performances. Samsung Electronics is a good example of a stock where FCF/\nEV analysis highlighted the stock as being undervalued, given the amount of cash on its balance sheet, and now some of this cash ow is being returned to shareholders. Recently, Samsung announced their updated shareholder return policy whereby 50% of its free cash  ow would be returned to shareholders each year in the form of dividends and share buybacks. This has helped to support Samsung Electronics’ share price performance and, importantly, our holding has been a key positive contributor to the Invesco Perpetual Asian Fund’s absolute and relative returns (MSCI AC Asia Paci c ex. Japan Index) over the last 10 years.\nFinally, while large cash balances provide a margin of safety, a catalyst is required for the full value of this cash to be factored into the share price, such as higher dividends, share buybacks or an acquisition. As a team, however, we do not have to identify a speci c catalyst before we invest as we believe that typically\nas soon as a catalyst is apparent then the share price reacts very quickly. We trust that our investment horizon is long enough to give time for a catalyst to emerge. However, we acknowledge the risk that in some cases a catalyst may not appear and the investment does not render value for shareholders.We\nrather take the risk of buying what we believe are undervalued stocks with limited downside, rather than buy stocks where there is a material risk of a de-rating, leading potentially to an investment declining in absolute terms.\nInvestment risks\nThe value of investments and any income\nwill  uctuate (this may partly be the result of exchange rate  uctuations) and investors may not get back the full amount invested.\nPast performance is not a guide to future returns.\nThis document is marketing material and\nis not intended as a recommendation to invest in any particular asset class, security\nor strategy.

Here, Newton multi-asset income manager, Paul Flood, explores the latest trends in the sector.\nIn the current low yield, low interest rate environment investment managers continue to explore the potential of ever more diverse asset classes. The growing popularity of multi-asset portfolios has helped extend the reach of managers into areas as diverse as gold, emerging markets, liquid alternatives and infrastructure.\nAviation  nance is another area attracting increasing interest from multi-asset managers. Banks which once played a major role in the market face growing pressure to limit external lending under capital adequacy requirements, such as Basel III, increasing the need for third-party investment support of funding in the aviation sector.\nOrder books remain robust. In July 2016, European aviation giant Airbus said it was poised to win US$26.8bn in new deals for 197 aircraft, with US rival Boeing separately reporting orders for 182 aircraft.1\nWith aircraft leasing increasingly the preferred choice for many airlines, the aviation  nance sector is proving an attractive business proposition for many investment managers as the number of\nleasing companies and investment vehicles entering the market expands.\nFor investors, medium- to long-term leasing contracts can provide stable and reliable cash ows over time, and the sector holds increasing appeal for institutions such as pension funds, insurance companies and sovereign wealth funds. Investments in aviation  nance also hold a relatively low correlation to other asset classes, in some cases making them a useful diversi cation tool in broader portfolios.\nYield Potential\nCommenting on potential investment opportunities in the market, Newton multi- asset income manager, Paul Flood said: “In a world where the search for yield continues and we have limited avenues to attain that, aviation  nance is an area in which signi cant yield can be generated as long as investors are careful about the types of contracts they enter into.”\nCommenting on some potential strengths\nto the aircraft leasing sector, he adds: “An important feature of the asset class is that because the dividend yields it delivers are generally high you can get a lot of cash ow back very quickly on investment and would have to see an extraordinary depreciation level before making a loss.\n\"Passenger traf c is also incredibly resilient.\nIn the last 40 years there were only two real occasions where we had negative year on year declines in passenger growth - 2001 post the 9/11 events and in 2009 after the  nancial crisis.\"\nExpanding on the types of aviation  nance related funds Newton invests in, and the way\n Aviation  nance is another area attracting increasing interest from multi-asset managers.

We have agreements where the planes which are leased have to be returned in ‘good as new’ condition through so-called “hell and high water” contracts.”\n“This means all the spare parts have to be returned as new and effectively you end up with an aircraft that is essentially returned  tted out with a completely new set of parts. As an investor, you are compensated for anything that needs to be replaced.”\nContract Strength\nWhile no asset class is risk free, Flood says the type of contracts commonly used in the industry are usually comparatively robust.\n“The good thing about the aviation  nance industry is that contracts tend to be very tight, very speci c and fully insured. Because aviation is such a regulated industry, regulatory checks take place all the time and that also delivers a degree of comfort for investors,” he says.\n“For anyone looking for income, aviation  nance could be a very attractive, sustainable income model, because it centres on long-term leases that will get paid unless the airline involved hits  nancial dif culties. Investors\nin this sector are not taking price risk on the cost of airline seats, capacity risk on whether the plane is fully utilised or not - that risk is shouldered solely by the airline industry.”\nThat said, Flood adds it is important to\nasses the health of underlying investment counterparties in order to minimise potential risk exposure.\n“As with many other investments, the strength of the counterparty is very important in this business, because if the counterparty were to become bankrupt investors could potentially end up having to lease out the aircraft in what would most likely be a weak business environment.”\nEmerging Markets growth\nOne of the key reasons for global optimisim in the sector is the growth in emerging markets seen over the past decade. This has increasingly spurred demand for air travel in regions such as Asia and Latin America.\n“Air passenger numbers have grown by about four or  ve per cent a year, with growth driven primarily by Asian emerging markets - in markets such as China - which have seen a steady rise in the number of middle income families.” Flood adds.\nOther factors underpinning the health of the sector include low oil prices - which have also helped extend the life of less fuel ef cient planes - growing liberalisation of the aviation sector and the development of airliners with increased capacity, such as the double deck Airbus A380, currently the world’s largest air passenger carrier.2\nDespite some concerns over European airline ‘capacity discipline’, and the impact of the UK’s 2016 vote to leave the EU on air travel to and from Britain, the longer-term industry outlook for aviation  nance appears bright.\nWhile the asset class remains relatively unknown to some investors, its popularity looks set to rise in the years ahead as the number of players in the market continues to grow, and its potential strengths become more widely recognised.\nThe value of investments can fall.

Given the outlook globally, a similar theme could soon occur in other developed markets.\nActive management has somewhat been a victim of its own success, with index funds increasingly competitive performance being somewhat attributable to the huge surge\nin  nancial professionals over the last half a century.\nWe have conducted our own investigation to understand two questions;\n1. Have active managers underperformed their benchmarks?\n2. Is the likelihood of outperformance limited to particular areas of the global market?\nWe have compiled a database of around 4,500 active equity funds available for sale across Europe which have a track record back to at least the beginning of 2010, and categorised them across 25 varied sectors. By capturing data since 2010 we avoid the anomalies following the global  nancial crisis as well\nas capturing the period in which passive\nstrategies have largely proliferated.\nTo justify fees, an active manager should\nbe considered ‘successful’ if they are able to deliver at least one, or ideally, a combination of the below;\n1. Better returns than the index after fees\n2. A positive risk adjusted return (in terms of Alpha) – meaning a more ef cient allocation of risk than the market\n3. A lower level of risk – to deliver an element of downside protection\nFor each of these measures, we judge success as being able to produce both;\n• A superior result over the entire seven year period since the beginning of 2010 and,\n• A better result in at least four of the individual seven calendar years from 2010 to 2016\nBy achieving the above, the manager will have produced both a superior result over time, and given the investor a realistic chance of capturing this by delivering some level of\nconsistency. The following chart displays the percentage of active funds within each of the underlying sectors which have delivered on the above measures of success.\nInitially, looking at which funds have returned in excess of their indices, the landscape seems bleak for active investors, only four of the 25 sectors have more outperforming managers than underperforming (marked with a 50% threshold in red) and only eight sectors have\na third of funds outperforming the indices (marked with a 33% threshold in black). To compound the problem, the most opportune areas for active managers are those which typically represent very small allocations of global benchmarks, such as regional small cap funds as well as smaller, regional emerging markets such as Indian, Latin American and emerging European equities. An area of optimism however, is within UK and UK Equity Income funds which have a strong history of active managers being able to outperform.\nThe result on a risk-adjusted return basis differs only marginally, but the trend does improve slightly in favour of the active managers. However, in the main, the larger allocations of the global equity market such as the US, Japan, global emerging market and broad global equity funds have less than a\n "," 23\n  The latest analysis of global fund  ows predicts that in the next few years, assets invested in passive strategies could overtake those in active funds in the US.\n third of managers being measured as successful. This does support the common belief that the more developed equity markets are more ef cient at pricing assets and therefore it’s more dif cult for active managers to outperform the index.\nFinally we look at risk. Should an active manager fail to provide improved returns, they should at least consistently provide an alternative strategy which can provide lower risk than the market, potentially offering some element of downside protection. Results improve slightly but in-line with the previous trends, the best sectors lie in the smaller, more esoteric, less well researched areas such as emerging markets, small cap and to a degree, more specialist areas of property and precious metal funds.\nIt is clear that a level of expertise is needed\nto select active managers which have the potential to outperform in a simple return sense. Despite the odds being skewed against us, we still employ a US equity sector specialist and we still believe we are able to  nd managers that can outperform in that sector and all others too.\nBut given the above evidence, passive strategies would seem an opportune means to gain market levels of performance whilst seeking to limit underperformance by bene tting from scale to reduce fees. Our role is to try and use the risk budget we have for each of our passive portfolios and allocate as ef ciently as possible between the different regions to deliver the best possible risk adjusted returns. As well as select and ensure that each passively managed underlying fund matches its risk and return characteristics as closely as possible and in the most cost-effective way.\nFor further market insight please visit www.adviserpointsofview.com For more information, call us on 020 7562 4900; Monday to Friday 9.00am – 5.00pm, calls may be recorded, or visit architas.com\nThis is for professional clients only and should not be distributed to, or relied upon by, retail clients.

The focus has been on lower costs, with passives the obvious, indeed only, choice in recent times. But is this the best the industry can do? And is this set to change?\nThe great DB gold rush\nPension freedoms have brought about a decline in the annuities market, and a commensurate rise in drawdown with multi-asset solutions becoming an important tool.\nThere has been an explosion of demand for transfers out of de ned bene t schemes, with retirees drawn by the increasingly attractive transfer values on offer, and the potential to\nmanage their retirement pot more  exibly.\nGovernment statistics suggest that 220,000 de ned bene t members have already transferred funds since 2015, including 80,000 between April 2016 and March 2017.

The FCA launched\nan investigation into pension transfer advice in 2017 and found that some of the advice investors were receiving at retirement fell short of expectations. Advisers can expect continued close supervision on the issue. The FCA’s position was already well-established, saying that suitability and costs must be\na priority for advisers. MiFID II looks set to build on this, pushing for appropriate recommendations, and for full, granular disclosure of charging on all investment products.\nA focus on cost is inescapable\nMuch of the demand for multi-asset products is already cost-constrained. Auto-enrolment, for example, is restricted to 75bps, including platform and fund fees, which has made it dif cult for advisers to participate. In practice, most pension products are likely to come with cost restrictions.\nAt the same time, advisers cannot neglect the risk side of the equation or they face the threat of falling foul of suitability rules. Mapping to existing risk models is vitally important, particularly as many advisers are using platforms to build their suitability process. Multi-asset funds must be clear on their risk parameters and ensure they align with client risk pro les.\nThe dramatic rise of passives\nToo often the solution from multi-asset providers has been based on passive products, which limits investment choices for consumers. Passive products do have an important role to play particularly within longer-term investment portfolios where the impact of market volatility is less critical. However, there are drawbacks to this. For example, it is often dif cult to achieve nuanced asset allocation from a portfolio of passive funds.\nThey may come with inherent biases – to large cap companies, for example, or to larger investment markets such as the US. It can\nbe dif cult to take exposure to certain asset classes.\nThe problem with being too passive\nA reliance on passive asset allocation may create problems. It may see decisions made based on historic correlations between\nasset classes and past volatility, neither of which may be particularly informative about what investors can expect in future. Loose monetary policy has created anomalies that may not persist as interest rates normalise.\nMulti-asset solutions need to take account of the changing risk dynamics of different asset classes over time, and changing relationships. Volatility analysis and stress testing are important, but there will also be speci c risks from individual positions and strategies – how exposed is a portfolio to interest rates, the\noil price, or other systemic shocks? In order to ensure ongoing suitability, and – perhaps more importantly – good, predictable investment performance, these factors have to be considered.\nAdvisers need a proven and repeatable, active investment process, from established teams with long track records, to give them proper peace of mind and to ensure they are meeting their regulatory and client obligations, while not compromising investment performance.\nMeeting all these needs at a low cost is a major challenge.\nTime for something extraordinary – a low cost active solution\nThe new BMO Universal MAP range strives to  nally do what the market is crying out for. It offers three risk targeted portfolio options– Cautious, Balanced and Growth\n- designed to cover a wide range of client needs. These needs may be reliable source\nof drawdown income to support them in retirement; or growth the client seeks to accumulate capital. Most importantly, each portfolio is actively managed, but at low cost. Expenses are capped at 0.29%  xed OCF, with a clear, transparent charging structure. It is an institutional calibre product that is now being made universally available.\nA breakthrough made possible through scale\nBMO Global Asset Management has been able to launch the Universal MAP range because of its scale. It operates in more than 25 cities in 14 countries, and currently manages around £189 bn in assets for clients. It has real depth of resource in multi-asset investing, managing around £50bn globally. Its globally diversi ed team has long-term experience developing multi-asset options for institutional clients across the globe. Source: BMO Global Asset Management, 30 June 2017.\nThe BMO Universal MAP range harnesses this depth of experience and resources. For each fund, asset allocation is adjusted and managed dynamically, across global equity and  xed income markets. All three funds draw from\n10 different asset classes, blending global equity and  xed income investments within a portfolio.\nThey invest in individual securities, derivatives, collective schemes and ETFs, with the aim of keeping costs low and delivering a predictable, long-term, in ation-adjusted return. The funds are risk targeted, and mapped to leading risk pro ling tools. The process has been extensively back-tested and has been used for BMO’s institutional clients for decades.\nAs with all investments it is important to remember that the value of investments and any income from them can go down as well as up and investors may get back less than the original amount invested.\nAll change\nA changing market place brings the need for new and innovative solutions, yet to date investors have faced a binary choice – low cost or active. For the  rst time, advisers and investors no longer have to choose, but can ensure suitability and risk targets are met, within a product that is also responsive and dynamic.

After years of disappointment, levels of business investment rose. Unemployment fell in developed markets, while wage in ation pressures remained largely absent. Meanwhile, emerging market fears dissipated as capital out ows reversed and growth stabilised.\nBuoyed by stronger growth and low discount rates, asset prices were strong across the board. Almost all equity markets delivered double-digit returns. In the bond market, tighter credit spreads accompanied stable government bond yields.\nAs we enter 2018, the question on investors’ minds is clear: will the bull market continue?\nFiring on all cylinders or moving late cycle?\nWe expect the economy to continue  ring on all cylinders in 2018, supported by easier bank lending conditions and US tax cuts. While the near-term risks appear balanced, the picture is less clear as we move deeper into the year.\nAfter almost nine years of uninterrupted equity market gains, there is a case to be made that it is time for a reversal of fortunes. Although an extended run of strong returns is not always reason to believe a correction is imminent, increasing recruitment dif culties and manufacturing utilisation are evidence of\ndiminishing slack. Unless growth slows, core in ation is likely to rise, which in turn will put pressure on corporate margins and the discount rates applied to future cash ows.\nTiming any corrections is dif cult but crucial, as market returns may stay strong until\njust before the in ection point. The risk of a correction will materially increase when we see the economy move to late cycle. As a result, investors need to be particularly wary of nascent recession risks, taking into account the typical 6-12 month lead of markets over the economic cycle.\nWith this in mind, we are focused on several emerging threats and potential triggers, which – combined with structural headwinds such as debt and demographics – could undermine global growth in the year ahead.\n1. Evolving Political Risks\nPolitical risks are evolving, not disappearing. While the populist politics we saw in 2016 and 2017 had little impact on markets, we remain wary of potentially disruptive political developments such as a protectionist agenda in the US, con ict in Asia or the Middle East, and elections in Latin America.\n We expect the economy to continue  ring on all cylinders in 2018, supported by easier bank lending conditions and US tax cuts.\nWhile the near-term risks appear balanced, the picture is less clear as we move deeper into the year.\n "," 27\n                                 However, the biggest political risk in 2018 could be what is not even on the calendar. In 2017, China’s leadership prioritised ‘stability at all costs’ ahead of October’s National\nturnover on the committee could lead to a fundamentally different perspective on the monetary policy outlook.\nSo far it appears controlled. Capital out ow and currency pressures have eased. Given the alarming increase in China’s debt in recent years, the authorities’ attempt to reduce leverage could be a positive development\nfor the medium term. But there are risks the economy could slow more than expected in the near term as funding becomes increasingly scarce.\nPreparing for a market correction\nThe conditions driving recent impressive equity market gains could stay in place this year. However, the market has priced in this optimism, implying greater vulnerability to disappointment.\nInvestors looking to adopt a prudent strategy can do so in three ways. The most active way is to stay long equities but keep the  nger on the trigger to reduce risk in response to more late cycle signals. A more systemic way is\nto gradually lower equity exposure as we go deeper into 2018. Finally, investors could add appropriate hedges to their portfolios – for instance, going long in ation, the US dollar and Japanese yen in portfolios that are also long market risk.\nThis is not a consumer advertisement. It is intended for professional  nancial advisers only and should not be relied upon by private investors or any other persons.\nThe value of investments and any income from them may fall as well as rise, and investors may get back less than they invest. Past performance is not a guide to future performance.\nAs required under applicable laws Legal & General will record all telephone and electronic communications and conversations with you that result or may result in the undertaking of transactions in  nancial instruments on your behalf.

Legal & General (Unit Trust Managers) Limited. Authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority\n Congress. This could mean a greater focus on tackling the structural challenges of high debt, environmental dilapidation and slowing trend growth. Such a pivot would imply downside risks in the near term.\n2. Badly timed US  scal stimulus\nIf in ation rises, the Federal Reserve (Fed) could raise interest rates faster than expected in the next two years. However, there are three scenarios that could keep in ation low again in 2018. First, disappointing US growth could take the heat out of the labour market. That being said, growth looks strong and there are few signs it will slow. In fact, with Congress likely to deliver stimulus worth close to 1% of GDP in 2018, this  scal boost risks overheating the economy at this stage in the cycle.\nSecond, an improvement in productivity would prevent unit labour costs from rising, even as wage growth climbs. If technological progress and greater retail competition\nkeep in ation down, this should help solve the productivity puzzle. Third, rising wage pressure could lead to a margin squeeze if  rms are unable to pass on higher costs, bringing the cycle to an earlier end.\nMarkets will have to adjust to the policy priorities and communication style of Jerome Powell as the new chair of the Fed. Asset prices could well be shaken up, as markets have become used to the gradualism and transparency of the old regime. Considerable\n3. Brexit blues in the UK\nIn stark contrast to the Eurozone, the UK economy slowed during 2017. Real incomes were squeezed as the Brexit-induced fall\nin sterling began to bite, while the housing market also cooled. A drag on business investment, Brexit uncertainty is likely to persist through 2018. While a transition deal is likely, there is still a risk of no agreement or outcomes that could lead to an early general election.\nAfter November’s hike in interest rates and combined with current economic uncertainty, the rate of future hikes is unlikely to speed up. But with the turn in the interest rate cycle, the international value of the pound is likely to  nd some support from the Bank of England.\n4. China: The elephant in the room\nGlobal manufacturing picked up steam in 2017, supported by a recovery in world trade growth and positive domestic demand in several emerging markets. We therefore remain optimistic about the prospects for emerging market debt where global trade is supportive.\nChina is the elephant in the room. Industrial activity appears to be slowing as the growth rates of various monetary aggregates diminishes, which – alongside the recent increases in Chinese domestic interest rates – is consistent with the authorities trying to take the heat out of rapid credit growth.\n ","  28\n Wealth management: a combination of  nancial planning and investment management\n Jonathan Webster-Smith | Director & Head of the Multi-Asset Team | Brooks Macdonald\nA holistic wealth management service will incorporate both advice and investment functions, which require a signi cant degree of technical understanding, considerable time and a great deal of effort.\nProfessional advisers’ intricate knowledge\nof their clients’ circumstances makes them best placed to provide expert  nancial advice. However, undertaking both generic  nancial advice and investment management services simultaneously can be challenging, particularly as investing is a specialist skill which often bene ts from the allocation of signi cant resources.\nServicing the adviser community: DFM due diligence in seven steps\nWe understand the issues facing professional advisers and offer them support by providing services that allow them to transfer their investment functions to a third party.While our business model is speci cally designed to help advisers that might bene t from insourcing their investment functions,\nwe appreciate that we are not the only Discretionary Fund Manager (DFM) operating within the UK wealth management industry.

This involves evaluations across four key areas:\n1. Range of services\n2. Performance transparency\n3. Back of ce systems and controls 4. Financial strength\nTo assist, independent third parties have undertaken analyses of each of these four core themes and advisers can use these to gain con dence in a DFM partner.

In this article we look in more details at due diligence and screening (of funds and platforms) and the value (to customers) of a Centralised Investment Proposition (CIP).\nDue diligence – challenge\nIt is a daunting prospect, when faced with over 9000 instruments in the UK (OEICs, Unit Trusts, ETFs, Investment Trusts and VCTs), to work out where to start with due diligence.\nBut having already completed a segmentation exercise the task is already becoming\nclearer. For example, if most of your\nclients, or a segment of them, are relatively unsophisticated investors who seek comfort from coverage by the FSCS – it is possible; to screen out whole categories of instruments.\nIf keeping costs below a threshold is a key element of your philosophy, then again many hundreds of more expensive investments can be screened out. In simple terms if you screen out products that are likely to deliver poor outcomes you must be left with a sub set that will deliver good outcomes!\nLink to your philosophy\nThis process can be used to further screen\nout products that fail to meet your criteria for each segment. For example, if you have a tier of clients with smaller investment amounts, it may be most effective for them to be offered a multi-asset solution. Single asset solutions would therefore be inappropriate. Further screens might include, fund size and alignment to the risk tool that you are using.\nThe key is to start with an open mind, use\nthe needs of your client segments and the beliefs articulated (and evidenced) in your Investment Philosophy to screen out products that are less likely to deliver good outcomes.\nEvidence\nOne of the key aspects that emerges from FCA comment on due diligence is the issue of status quo bias. In simple terms it is just using the same approved list as last year without really challenging your assumptions. The dif culty is keeping the approved list up to date without the mammoth task of screening the whole universe every year or so. The screening out process above simpli es this by allowing you to remove whole categories that are not suitable, and thus focussing effort on selecting (and updating) from those that are.\nKeeping a simple log of the process and outcomes allows you to satisfy both the FCA but most importantly shows your customers that you have a robust and independent process for selecting solutions. And, of course, this is a very valuable process for customers. The time it would take each of them to\n "," 31\n  The world of investment solutions is much broader than just funds – model portfolios and bespoke mandates have exploded in popularity over recent years.\nshortlist and screen the investment universe is substantial – and thus a key element of your value is the time it saves them.\nWider Investment Solutions\nOf course, the world of investment solutions is much broader than just funds – model portfolios and bespoke mandates have exploded in popularity over recent years.\nBut your approach should be consistent – linking to client segmentation / needs and adviser investment philosophy:\n• If your philosophy leads you to passive solutions you can screen out active.\n• If cost is an issue, then it is likely that MPS could be more effective than full bespoke DFM (but depends on scale and mandate required).\n• If adherence to a risk pro le is important, then understanding how the mandate is run is key.\n• If you are interested in active managers, then a comparison of risk adjusted returns compared to a consistent benchmark (ideally the adviser’s chosen one) will be important – probably over a number of time periods.\nPlatforms\nA similar screening out process using customer needs and your investment philosophy and process can be equally applied to platform selection. For the FCA perspective, look at the Factsheet 12 on using Platforms some years ago – it is one of the simplest\nand most helpful guides they produce – well worth a read\nhttps://www.fca.org.uk/publication/ other/fs012-platforms-using-fund- supermarkets-and-wraps.pdf\n One of the key aspects that emerges from FCA comment on due diligence is the issue of status quo bias.

Whether for self-driving automobiles or  nancial advisory relationships, people need to trust\nin a product, service or fellow human being in order to secure their physical or  nancial well-being.\nAnd while I don't believe the importance of trust is overlooked by many people, I do believe it is more complicated than most people think.\nToday's advice industry has moved meaningfully towards fee-based compensation, and in this environment, attracting new clients and retaining existing clients are paramount. The good news is\nthat trust appears to be a key component – perhaps the key component – for improving both referrals and client retention. Recent Vanguard research clearly illustrates the relationship between these important factors for an advisory practice's prosperity1. Also, it provides an additional insight that might be easily overlooked: It's not any level of trust but a high level of trust that matters to clients.\nAs you can see in the chart opposite, clients who have high levels of trust in their advisers are far more likely to provide referrals or stay with their advisers than clients who have even a moderate level of trust.\nTrust is the key to referrals and retention\n 1 Anna Madamba and Stephen P. Utkus, 2017. Trust and  nancial advice. Valley Forge, Pennsylvania: The Vanguard Group.\nSources: Vanguard and Chadwick Martin Bailey, a market strategy  rm.\nIntuitively, this seems to make sense. After all, would you allow yourself or your family to ride in a self-driving car if you only sort of trusted its ability to take you where you needed to go safely?\nSo if gaining a high level of trust is the goal, what can you do?\nTrust is complicated\nIt is important to recognise that 'trust' has more than one de nition.\nI conducted an informal poll of friends, family and advisers for a little while, asking them, 'How would you de ne trust?' Completely unscienti c, I know, but interesting nonetheless.\n "," 37\n  Today's advice industry has moved meaningfully towards fee-based compensation, and in this environment, attracting new clients and retaining existing clients are paramount.\nTrust has several dimensions\nSources: Vanguard and Chadwick Martin Bailey.\nTypically, people de ned it in one of two ways. Many de ned it from an ethical perspective:\n'I trust that a person will act in my best interest.' Others tended to de ne it based on a functional viewpoint: 'I trust that people\nwill do what they say they would do.' But hardly anyone's initial de nition was based on emotions, i.e. how trust made the person feel.\nAgain, our data show why this is so important. When asked which de nition of trust mattered the most to them, more than half\nof the advised investors surveyed said it was the emotional one (see chart above). So while the emotional de nition was the one least frequently mentioned in my informal poll,\nit seemed to be the one that mattered the most to people based on our research survey. Interesting.\nPeople, not portfolios\nYou can do other things – simple things – to build higher levels of trust and signal your commitment to and your concern for your clients:\n• 'Hey, how are you doing?' calls: How often do you call clients just to see how they're doing, with no portfolio-related objective in mind? Treat them as people, not portfolios.\n• Instead of asking, 'How are the kids?' ask, 'How are Jane and Jim?' Essentially the same question but with a more personal touch.\nWhile I don't believe investors would have any trust in someone they believe doesn't\nact in their best interest or is unreliable, I also believe the secret to closing the gap between high trust and moderate trust lies in advisers' better understanding the impact of emotional trust. Making sure your clients feel valued\nand taken care of can go a long way toward closing the trust gap.\nAs mentioned above, whilst trust is the gateway to client referrals and retention, high trust is likely key for success.\nImportant information:\nThis article is directed at professional investors and should not be distributed to, or relied upon by, retail investors.\nThis article is designed only for use by, and is directed only at, persons resident in the UK.

I think the integrity and detail personal stories bring make all the difference in connecting with individuals in similar situations.\nWith this in mind I would like to share some things that happened to some people I love this January.\nGreat Grandad Bill\nBill was my wife’s step-Grandad, and our children’s Great Grandad. Great Grandad Bill was in his early 80s and had lost his wife of over 50 years in October last year. She was a lovely lady who had diabetes and in her later days dementia, and he was always by her side, putting her  rst.\nIn those three months he mourned the loss\nof his soulmate and life partner and began to establish a new future for himself. Our children spent more time with him including at my wife’s father’s birthday party. The day after Grandad’s party we were shocked to learn that Great Grandad Bill had died having his morning shower. This led to the  rst conversations\nwith our  ve-year-old son about death and\nall the various dif cult and thought-provoking questions that need to be answered.\nGreat Auntie Pat\nAuntie Pat was the healthiest 86-year-old you’re ever likely to meet. She swam every day, was\na proli c gardener and had that mischievous twinkle in her eye, more commonly seen in a cheeky child than someone of her experience. On New Year’s Eve we were therefore shocked to be told that she was in hospital with Guillan Barre syndrome. This unusual disease is one I know about as an underwriter but hoped never to encounter in my real life.\n More fundamentally it’s made me consider what we really want insurance to be for. Most protection propositions act as a safety net for those who fall, to stop them just before they hit the ground.\n ","  39\n What we call “Income Protection” is in reality sickness insurance or even inability to work due to sickness insurance. The real life events that have occurred to me and will be happening to many other families this month remind me of the need to truly help people.\nIn the four weeks that followed, Auntie Pat remained in hospital and had multiple blood transfusions. Throughout this time she remained on a ventilator with paralysis of her limbs and limited movement in her face. At the end of January she was asked to make a decision as to whether she would like to continue to be on the ventilator or to have the ventilator taken away in palliative care.\nMy son Alex\nMy son Alex is  ve. He is an energetic, cheery, mischievous and utterly brilliant young boy. One Thursday I took a call to say “there is nothing\nto worry about but Alex had fallen over in the school playground”. Having gone up to school to comfort him, 36 hours later we were leaving hospital with Alex’s leg in plaster from his toes to the top of his thigh, with 8 weeks ahead off school.\nSo – why these stories? Because they are true. Because they affected my life. Because the protection industry may hear them and says “that’s sad, but what’s it got to do with us?”\nObviously in different ways each of these incidents has had a huge impact on us. The emotional impact, the tears shed, the time both visiting and arranging to see the individuals and other family members.\nLooking after Alex is now a full-time job split between my wife, grandparents and myself. The joy and opportunity to spend time with him as he learns to read (and is introduced to computer games!) has been immense – but it has caused a lot of life juggling.\nIt’s tempting to conclude this with a suggestion that there needs to be an insurance product designed for people like me – people who have a really rubbish month once every 5 years and could do with a bit of help to get through it. But even I would admit that’s probably a bit self- obsessed and reactive.\nMore fundamentally it’s made me consider what we really want insurance to be for. Most protection propositions act as a safety net for those who fall, to stop them just before they hit the ground. I think we should be aiming higher and offering to step into the motorcycle riding display team or Spanish  esta tower to enable someone to continue to soar rather than just not to crash.\nIn the time I spent in hospital with my son I heard others stories. Each set of parents had unique circumstances, individual needs and would have made different decisions as to what the most helpful thing for them and their family was at that point.\nWe must aspire to give someone a choice as to whether they want support to stay at the top of their tower or need help to get safely down for a while.\nOne short month ago I thought the fuss around the name of income protection was more navel-gazing from an industry that prefers to talk than to do. These experiences remind me\nof what a limited amount of protection we actually provide. This is particularly true for the self-employed like myself and my wife who have the ability to be  exible in trying times but must juggle that against the lost income.\nWhat we call “Income Protection” is in reality sickness insurance or even inability to work due to sickness insurance. The real life events that have occurred to me and will be happening to many other families this month remind me of the need to truly help people.\nThe danger with real life stories is there aren’t always happy endings or even perfect  ts or easy solutions. This article doesn’t have an emphatic conclusion that readers still with\nme may have hoped for. I simply hope it helps enable one more person to have one more conversation about their experiences. Thank you for listening to mine.\n ","           40\n                         Synaptic Analyser: Cash ow is king\nAs a welcome surprise at a time of greater-than-ever regulation, newcomers to cash ow modelling are  nding that there are several advantages of using Synaptic Analyser when it comes to conducting reviews.\nAs is well known, the evolution of  nancial planning in the UK relied heavily on cash ow modelling, which was one of the hallmarks of practitioners within the old IFP. In those days, many will recall that there was something of a divide between those who did, and those who didn’t.\nDemographics and Pension Freedoms have changed the dynamic in the market by promoting the importance of retirement and post-retirement planning - advisers must have the relevant tools to analyse income\nin retirement, with the result that it is now dif cult to imagine advice without a cash ow analysis of some kind. Knowing your client means working with de ned objectives, and this can’t be done without considering growth projections against objectives.\nSynaptic Analyser has been designed with advisers who may be newcomers to cash ow modelling. It is worth pointing out that although retirement planning has certainly increased, according to our recent audit,\nthe majority of advice is still very much in accumulation. Many of the newcomers to cash ow modelling are discovering that the tool provides a very effective method of\nbringing a saver's  nancial plan to life as part of advice in accumulation too.\nThecurrentpensionconsultationpaper CP17/16 is in, and  ndings will be published shortly. A major theme is the requirement for advisers to assume full responsibility for their advice on a case-by-case basis. It is impossible to rely on third-party, generic illustrations. Only proper research, utilising actual scenario details will do. This is reinforced, by the way, in the new MiFID regime ex-ante and ex-post proof of suitability. The more rigorous scrutiny of advice at review will expose unsubstantial forecasts and inaccurate cost analysis.\nThe central proposition of the CP17/16 paper is that consumer protection requires pensions advice to be ‘a personal recommendation’. ‘We propose to require all advice on the transfer and conversion of safeguarded bene ts to include a personal recommendation’. (clause 3.10)\nThrivingwithintheregulatoryrequirements will require an up-skilling on use of research tools for many  rms, particularly in the pension area. Adoption of Synaptic Analyser will assist in that area, as it has several\nunique features in addition to those generally available:\n1. Abilitytoaccessaccurateannuityrates from within the tool (including the enhanced rates that most retirees are entitled to). This will enable the advisers to work with the new ‘Appropriate Pension Transfer Analysis’ and ‘Transfer value Comparator’ calculations (replacing the old critical yield calculation. This is a big upheaval as the current ‘value analysis requirement (TVA) is on the way out):\n‘Adviser  rms will be responsible for ensuring the APTA, including the TVC,\nis undertaken to a suf cient degree to support a suitable recommendation. Advice  rms are liable for the advice even where it is checked by a third-party pension transfer specialist. Consequently, advisory  rms must make sure that any software used meets their advice needs’.\n2.

The Synaptic questionnaire is from A2Risk, the most widely used ATRQ in the UK. Its popularity perhaps re ects the strength of the academic rigour behind the question set, and the reliability it has demonstrated across a variety of applications.\nThe questionnaire is used by Royal London and Vanguard amongst others, but much of its prestige comes from its alignment with Moody’s Analytics (formerly Barrie + Hibbert), the leading investment risk model (by far).\nFor many years organisations at an institutional level have relied on the Moody’s simulation-based (stochastic) model, but\nnow advisers can fully access Moody’s expertise through Synaptic. Many propositions reference the Moody’s risk metrics, but Synaptic gives advisers full access to the stochastic projections, which can be used to build investment strategies using the asset allocations as well as recommend and review portfolios. All this is possible with automated access and very low expense.\nIn referencing the ‘investment strategy’, the truth that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link fully applies. The investment outcomes of clients are simply too important to risk making mistakes, or not achieving consistently at the highest possible level. All elements must be aligned and functioning properly for the system to work.\nOur colleagues at RSMR recently wrote about Modern Portfolio Theory and this elicited some responses around the contribution made by Harry Markovitch around his work on modern portfolio theory. I watched a recent video for GuidedChoice (US) of Markovitch re ecting on the contribution that advisers are able to make to their clients’  nancial well-being. Having the structure, discipline and patience to reap the rewards of the markets is no small matter. He discusses the central truth of investment, that ‘in the long run’, reaching for greater gains will by necessity result in higher volatility\n‘in the short run’, and that embracing the correct balance of risk and return is what will\nensure that the client doesn’t ‘chicken out of the program’ when the volatility kicks in. (His words!).\nWe know from following the ombudsman’s rulings that advisers who end up in dispute and have not employed a robust process to evaluate risk and return lose every time and rightly so. It is a thing of great beauty that such consistency and success is achievable by marrying a few simple questions asset allocations.\nMany individual items contribute to overall success. Investment platforms, providers,\n Every year there is a slew of articles about ‘serious concerns’ about risk pro ling. Do any of the criticisms really stick when it is done properly? No. The adviser remains  rmly in control and these tools are able to enhance his or her expertise.\n ","     43\n                          Many propositions reference the Moody’s risk metrics, but Synaptic gives advisers full access to the stochastic projections, which can be used to build investment strategies using the asset allocations as well as recommend and review portfolios.\n cheaper share classes, star managers, streamlined businesses, automated engagement, quali cations, tax optimisation can all be part of the mix, but in investment terms, all are nothing without the solid foundation of competent risk pro ling, an adviser’s expert assessment of ‘capacity for loss’ and alignment to investments whose pro les are effectively assessed for risk and return.\nEvery year there is a slew of articles about ‘serious concerns’ about risk pro ling. Do any of the criticisms really stick when it is done properly? No. The adviser remains  rmly in control and these tools are able to enhance his or her expertise. A2Risk and Moody’s are constantly examining their assumptions, conducting new research, re-running their models and up-dating their customers – how can you replicate that?\nRory Percival’s report on risk-pro ling last year had an enormous in uence, prompting many  rms to try and better understand (and account for) the role of risk pro ling in their businesses. Appreciation for the leading risk pro ling tools increased, and progress was certainly made in helping  rms move towards their MiFID II requirements of knowing their tools (and their limitations).\nA slightly less valuable result of the report was the inference that risk pro ling should conform to an industry standard. For example in his comments about the ’50 client’ Rory wrote ‘in theory, given that the risk pro ling tools generally map clients onto the normal distribution of clients in the UK, the ’50 client’ should score 50 with all the tools’.\nSounds reasonable but it only tends to conform if the same ‘population sample’ is used in research across the tools. Research\ninto the general population (risk averse)\nwill calibrate differently to research into\nthe population of wealthier income earners (clients). Following these comments, A2Risk has seen the need to shift its methodology around population sample, and in doing so losing a sensible ‘anchor’ into the general population, and thus, arguably, losing some perspective. Not a great deal perhaps, but I think we should all resist pressure to look and act the same, for conformity’s sake – that’s where mono-culture develops and systemic risk grows.\nIn the update, there are minor changes around the identi cation of ‘very cautious investors’ and the language in some of the questions (for example volatility is out, to be replaced by more everyday language).With these minor changes enacted, the questionnaire feels more user friendly. Many advisers felt that the calibration of the risk categories seemed ‘too high’ and\nwill be happier now, and the expansion of the more Cautious bands should help secure a more comfortable  t across the range.\nAdvice from A2Risk on adopting the new questionnaire is as follows:\n‘Customers who have completed the previous version of the ATRQ can complete the new version when their portfolio is reviewed. There may be minor changes in the score at that point due to the updating of the logarithm. In this case, the change can be discussed with the client and a  nal category agreed. For most customers, there will be no change, unless their own answers to the statements have changed’.\nAny adviser can access the A2R questionnaire as part of the Synaptic Suite free of charge. Call 0800 783 4477 for access.\n ","           44\n                     Surviving the MiFID\nII juggernaut:\nThe most important perspective is investment risk\n Eric Armstrong | Product Marketing | Synaptic Software Limited\nAs many have commented, themes that have emerged in the new MiFID rules are actually UK regulatory concepts that have been ‘sold in’ to the European bureaucratic machine and returned to the UK as part of Europe wide regulation.\nIt shouldn’t come as a surprise that there are some dif cult adjustments to make as things always get lost in translation. ESMA is the independent EU authority that is missioning to safeguard the EU’s  nancial system by ‘enhancing the protection of investors and promoting stable and orderly  nancial markets’. This is the same as the FCA’s role of ‘make  nancial markets work well so that consumers get a fair deal’.\nIt is true that most recent thematic reviews relating to the quality of advice have been comfortable with ‘outcomes’, and comfortable with the job advisers have done in coaching and supporting their customers towards brighter  nancial futures. However, the reports have been universally scathing about the quality of research provided. It is new standards of disclosure and proof of suitability that are going to hurt some  rms.\nRecall Thematic Review 16/1 (Assessing suitability), that attributed poor investment outcomes to ‘poor quality of an advisory  rm’s research and due diligence’. Good  rms, the\npaper maintains, exhibit a culture of ‘challenge’, and are performing appropriate research regularly and consistently. They are certainly not over reliant on their favourite product providers or platforms.\nConsultation Paper 17/16 (4.34) has picked up the theme stating that:\n“ rms should be able to satisfy themselves that the use of such\nsoftware is not expected to result in the channelling of business from the advisory  rm to the provider or platform and\ndoes not need to be relied upon by the advisory  rm in the future in order to continue to service its clients.”\nMy worry is that the approach to MiFID that many advisers are adopting is to increase reliance on providers, rather than seek to establish independent research to meet the challenges.\nThe new concept of ‘ex-ante’ and ‘ex-post’ disclosure and review adds a further interesting twist. Before, ‘research’ often meant that\nyou had looked at something. The new\nworld requires evidence of how accurate the assumptions/illustrations/forecasts were. Many of us despaired in the old days at the quality of what passed for ‘research’, as we knew the data was wrong, or it had too little academic or intellectual rigour behind it. A speci c requirement of MiFID is that all tools are understood, including their shortcomings. Poor quality research will be found out quickly, as the audit trail needs to be maintained and data that is wrong and has a material impact on client outcomes will quickly come back to bite the adviser.\nAt Synaptic, many of our customers are\nlarger groups whose compliance departments are working furiously to put processes in place, whether they be templates for fund recommendations or tick boxes for reviews. However, many are independent advisers, many of which are directly authorised and will have to  gure this out for themselves.\nMy advice would be to stick to quality tools that facilitate reviews and illustrate costs in\n ","     45\n                          Poor quality research will be found out quickly, as the audit trail needs to be maintained and data that is wrong and has a material impact on client outcomes will quickly come back to bite the adviser.\ndetail such as Synaptic Comparator; and tools that provide accurate (proven historically) probability-based forecasts for growth and potential loss, such as Synaptic Modeller (built around the Moody’s model). Three of the six categories outlined in the ESMA MiFID template relating to ‘Target Markets’ relate\nto risk/reward management (Ability to bear losses/Risk Tolerance and Client objectives). Keep your focus on managing these and the bureaucratic challenge will start to appear more manageable. It is always better to paddle your own canoe than rely on what comes from above!\nSynaptic Risk – complete framework for success\nATRQ\nSupplied by A2R, the ATRQ in Modeller is also accessible through the Synaptic Suite (please call 0800 783 4477 to request access). In aggregate is the most widely used questionnaire in the industry as it is aligned with Vanguard, Royal London and other market leaders. Moody’s recommend the A2R questionnaire when working with their risk models.\nInvestment strategy\nThis is de ned out of the industry’s leading risk management model, the Moody’s stochastic engine that has been proven over decades, including the downturn and subsequent\nmarket turmoil. It provides a range of probable outcomes for any investment\n(on a client-by-client basis using Synaptic Modeller), as well as a measure for downside risk (likely losses in the worst year for any strategy over a 20-year term). You are able to use the latter measure as a measure for risk, in order to accurately and consistently assess ‘Capacity for Loss’ for clients.\nRisk Ratings\nAligned with the ATRQ and the Investment strategy are the Synaptic Risk Ratings. These are calculated using the Moody’s model, and are free from the ‘committee-based’ bias of competing approaches. The Synaptic ratings are widely published, used by more and more  rms to meet the more exacting requirements of modern pension advice and MiFID requirements.\nSynaptic Risk Ratings - graph showing ef

Otherwise Synaptic Risk Ratings assume a 10 year investment horizon. You should consult Royal London directly for further information before recommending.\nAbout the service: Synaptic Risk Ratings are worked out by analysing the underlying asset classes within the fund or portfolio. Synaptic Software have requested asset allocation information from participating providers in a specific format aligned to the risk framework of the system. These asset classes are used by the model to determine the risk rating, a process that may result in a level of approximation though in most cases this will be insignificant. It is also possible that certain asset classes may not be represented exactly in the manner that providers would prefer.\nReasonable endeavours are made to provide accuracy and consistency, however neither participating providers nor Synaptic Software can be held responsible for any errors or omissions. No recommendation should be made solely on the basis of the Synaptic Risk Ratings, and additional research should be undertaken for any case. This service is intended for use by investment professionals only.\n","                                     The Suitability Suite\nRisk . Costs . Due diligence .
