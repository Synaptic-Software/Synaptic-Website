It’s about the only\nskill I have, following a brief stab at world tennis domination that was cruelly ended by a staggering lack of talent. But seriously, spreadsheets, data, statistics and making sense of all that nonsense that normal people avoid has been my forte for 15 or so years. I’ve always found it second nature in a way I can’t really explain. I enjoy it too, what with being a massive nerd.\nYet, the spring of 2012 I found myself increasingly unable to perform even the most basic elements of my job. Stuff that would have been plain sailing, like rudimentary spreadsheet calculations (we’re talking long before the world-famous lang cat complex heatmaps by the way) were impossible to me. Lost in some kind of inexplicable fug.\nAt first, what with being a man, I thought I had some kind of flu. Fatigue? Lack of\nconcentration? Yep, one of those viruses that’s going around.\nWhat I’ve not mentioned is that I had all kinds of personal hell kicking off in the background and I hadn’t really pieced together that the two could be related. Fast forward a couple of months and it all came crashing down. Signed off work for 6 weeks or so with a cocktail of stress, anxiety and depression. Worst cocktail ever.\nI told you this column would be completely different.\nSo, why am I treating my quarterly Connection column like a bargain basement celebrity autobiography? ‘Steve Nelson: The difficult early years’, destined for a pound shop near you.\nWell, a number of reasons really. Firstly, it’s only with a bit of distance that I’ve been able to talk about it properly without a sense of shame. Stupid isn’t it? I didn’t choose to be unwell and it shouldn’t define who I am, but I felt it would if I talked about it. Like I said, stupid, isn’t it?\nSecondly, I reckon there’s a bit of a cultural shift going on and I think people are starting to talk about and address the issue of mental\n There’s a bit of a cultural shift going on and I think people are starting to talk about and address the issue of mental health.\n "," 5\n            Mental health problems in the UK workforce cost employers almost £35 billion last year. The number of working days lost per worker per year in financial services because of stress is now 31% higher than the average between 2007 and 2010.\nhealth, not least of all within financial services, in a more productive manner. And I want to do my bit to help it along.\nI’m mindful that this is a financial services column for financial services-type people so here’s quick stat attack on some of the direct implications that poor mental health can have on our economy:\n• Mental health problems in the UK workforce cost employers almost £35 billion last year, according to research by the Centre for Mental Health.\n• This means that mental health problems cost £1,300 for every employee in the UK economy.\n• The number of working days lost per worker per year in financial services because of stress is now 31% higher than the average between 2007 and 2010, employment law specialist Fox & Partners found in an analysis of Health and Safety Executive figures.\nMy own experience of talking about this has been illuminating. I did a wee podcast with the good people at Citywire a few months back on the topic of mental health in financial services, chatting about some of my experiences in\nthe past. It snowballed into a number of events on the road with Citywire, where we’ve\ncollectively tried to do our bit to contextualise mental health within the financial services sector and look at what we could all perhaps do a bit better to look after each other.\nThe reaction to it has been mildly overwhelming, with lots of lovely people saying very nice things. But it’s only the start. One thing in particular that I am growing to dislike is the term ‘awareness’ that seems to plague this topic. I think we need to move past that stage and move onto direct action.\nAnd it’s not going to be one thing that does it. We need different aspects to work in tandem. For me it’s all very well having initiatives\nin place in big firms but you need folk to demonstrate leadership to make staff believe they can be used effectively. In my work with Citywire I’ve been privileged to share a stage with Paul Feeney and hear about the terrific work he’s doing at Quilter. And I firmly believe that the main reason those initiatives will succeed is that they’re being led by a man willing to share his own vulnerability. Forget sales targets, reporting lines and awards. That’s leadership right there.\nSimilarly, as much as conversations about people, men in particular, needing to ‘open up’ about mental health may well be true, we need to develop the right societal framework to allow that to happen. That’s why I’m\ngrateful to the likes of Ollie Smith, Rohan Sivajoti and of course Paul for forcing this onto the mainstream financial services agenda and making it closer to being ok for others to follow.\nAt the risk of using up my entire annual preaching quota in one column, there’s one thing I’d like to leave you with. When I see some of the more acerbic criticism in the press, below the line commentary and some of the more forthright exchanges on Twitter\n– particularly some of the consequences of controversial replatforming exercises or the recent fallout from that fund suspension – I’m drawn towards the subject of mental health. Not because I think organisations don’t deserve criticism, quite the opposite, just\nthat those who are in line to feel the worst implications (i.e. potential job losses or front- line servicing stress) are usually those furthest from the decision-making process.\nI’m as guilty as the next person of this but\nI often wonder how much better it would\nbe if we were all 5% kinder to each other, particularly in times of stress. Or even just 1%. We could all do that, couldn’t we?\nVisit www.langcatfinancial.co.uk for more from Steve and the rest of the lang cats.\n  ","         6\n                      Research matters\n  Eric Armstrong | Client Director | Synaptic Software Limited\n Contains research from the lang cat\nResearch does matter now - but not as much as it will do in the coming years.\nAs a traveller through our times, do things seem stable to you? Does the low inflation environment or challenges around liquidity cause loss of sleep? I worry about the European deadline and have been reflecting on the various insights provided by various industry experts. I wonder about the growth we have had over the last 10 years and am concerned about what it is hiding.\nI also reflect on the fall-from-grace of a certain fund with its own liquidity issues, and the subsequent scrutiny that ‘gatekeeping’ has attracted and think of the implications for any research that may have supported decisions that led to failure, using dreaded hind-sight.\nWe don’t know what the tribulations ahead of us are, so anticipating the necessity to defend historic decisions causes us to reflect on what research means, and its role in providing evidence as to the decisions we make.\nIt turns out that a certain, very large advisory group had a significant mandate with ‘that’ fund promoter, so theoretically could have caught a nasty cold. Except they didn’t, partly because they had control of the custody in\na segregated mandate (so weren’t affected by the demand for redemptions), but also because their homework had established that the particular fund manager’s stock picking in un-quoted stocks, when analysed apart from their other investments, had not returned\nvalue historically. So un-quoted stocks were excluded from the mandate, and the group swerved considerable harm as a result. That seems to me to be an excellent example of valuable research.\nOur benign 10 years in the markets are\nlike the proverbial rising tide. Everybody invested has benefitted from nearly all asset classes recording growth. So not too much\nto defend. In the meantime, the regulatory authorities that were heavily criticised for being asleep at the wheel at the last downturn have been preparing the ground for far\nmore rigid enforcement relating to the two principal pillars of their mission: prudence/risk management and protection of the consumer.\nMiFID is a perfectly formed vehicle to deliver on this mission, and the FCA has already made announcements in relation to thematic reviews that will double down on the principles enshrined in the RDR and MiFID, with Proof of Suitability taking centre stage. Advisers have taken greater responsibility for their client’s assets through pension freedoms. With increased use of platforms, there is more at stake than ever before should firms fail to evidence consistent and meaningful research.\nThe big game changer has been the shift in strategy around research and due diligence required by the regulator. Accompanying stringent disclosure requirements that are\nmaking everybody’s eyes water along with the proof of target market, the new MiFID rules now require a full Suitability review to be conducted at least annually.\nIt won’t be enough to present a list of holdings, agree that the world is well, and that progress is being made. Suitability will only be deemed met if:\n• there is a demonstrable plan;\n• that set objectives are still current; and • that a client’s risk profile is up to date.\nThere must be an appropriate investment strategy that aligns with a client’s plan.\nIn the past 6 months, Synaptic has focused on user research around MiFID challenges as well as suitability. The extensive research also involved interviews with software users, focusing on advisers and paraplanners.\n ","     7\n                          With increased use of platforms, there is more at stake than ever before should firms fail to evidence consistent and meaningful research. The big game changer has been the shift in strategy around research and due diligence required by the regulator.\n A brave call to discount possibility of 1% US Treasury yield in the next few years\n We have drawn some emerging themes out of the research that you may find of interest when developing or reviewing your own research capabilities:\n1. Where’s all the data? Why can’t it all be in the right place?\nA challenge recognised by firms everywhere, spending hours collating data from various sources to populate ex-ante and ex-post (pre and post transaction) reports. A challenge so big that some firms prefer not to take on new customers, cull existing or bail out altogether. Most tools cannot stitch the portfolio and product layers together across all AUM.\n2. As ‘aggregation’ of firms affects more businesses, where is the software to support more joined up businesses?\nA challenge exists around the ability for increasingly ‘verticalised’ businesses to combine management of their legacy books and work in a more modern streamlined business, consistent with practices across a wider group.\n3. Firms are used to dealing with multiple software vendors. Is this avoidable?\nIt may be a firm’s preference, but issues with compatibility are making it difficult to sustain, especially now suitability is to be reviewed annually.\n4. The flow of data around the system still isn’t right.\nFirms prefer to co-ordinate things from the back office. However, integrations aren’t what they should be, and re-keying is famously as inefficient and laborious as ever.\n5. Retirement planning is becoming more important and the tools are struggling to keep up.\nThe wider adoption of cash-flow models has helped, but pension freedoms require more skilled research than ever to evidence the quality of firms’ retirement planning.\n6. Tools are struggling to deal with the wide range of investment ‘pathways’, where regulation and research strategies may vary.\nDiscretionary managed, insured, multi-asset, model or bespoke portfolios all require different treatment from the research point- of-view.\n"," 8\n   The FCA Thematic Review that set out the importance of RDR and FAMR: the next chapter. The FCA’s work is research, due diligence and a ‘culture of challenge’ never done.\n                             The themes coming through may not be\nnews to the majority of advisers, however the age-old problems still persist.

Beware of the FOJI!\n Simon Evan-Cook | Senior Investment Manager | Premier\nInvestors remain cautious and according to Simon Evan-Cook, Senior Investment Manager for Premier’s multi-asset funds, the last decade was filled with FOJI (Fear of Joining In). So, should investors act now or wait for a better opportunity?\nSince 2009, being a FOJI victim has been a costly experience.\n£100k stashed in a savings account earning the UK base rate for the last decade has grown to £105k. With inflation higher than the base rate for most of that time, the investor would have become poorer in real terms.\nIf they had chosen to invest in UK equities, they would now have something in the region of £267k.\nNow, you should – rightly – be sceptical\nof such numbers. Travelling back ten years returns us to the end of the financial crisis. This is as close as we’ve been to a closing- down, all-stock-must-go equity sale in living memory. So, it’s not surprising returns look good from then.\nMany would-be investors look back wistfully: “If it fell that low again,” they say, “I’d definitely be a buyer”. Neatly forgetting, of course, that when it fell that low last time, they stayed out because it was too scary. But rest assured, if it fell that low again it would be similarly terrifying.\nInvesting (or not) ten years ago: the results\n300,000\n250,000\n200,000\n150,000\n100,000\n50,000\n0\n30/06/2009 30/06/2010 30/06/2011 30/06/2012 30/06/2013 30/06/2014 30/06/2015 30/06/2016 30/06/2017 30/06/2018\n                           FTSE All-Share Index\nUK consumer price     Bank of England base rate\n    Perhaps then, we should compare today’s should-I-or-shouldn’t-I investment dilemma to 2007: a time when years of good returns projected an enticing scene onto the rear- view mirror, but investors were uneasy that they’d be joining the picnic too late. What fate befell those that did?\nWell, assuming they bought in and stayed, they too would have been better off than\nthose who chose cash. Put another way, if Paul put his £100k into UK equities at the very peak of that cycle (31st October 2007), the day before the UK market embarked on a 17-month, 46% slump, he’d still be better off today than Pauline, who left her money in a bank account paying the heady (but soon-to-be-slashed) base rate of 5.75%.\n ","  Investing at the peak of the last market cycle (or not): the results\n200,000\n180,000\n160,000\n140,000\n120,000\n100,000\n11\n As well as understanding how you’d feel if the market drops sharply in the next 12 months, you should also consider how you’d feel if it rises for the next 12 years while your cash dwindles away.\n         80,000\n 60,000\n 40,000\n 20,000\nFind out more\nFor more information about Premier’s funds or portfolios, contact our Business Development team on 0333 456 9033 or email info@premierfunds.co.uk\nVisit premierfunds.co.uk/global\n 0\n31/10/2007 31/10/2008 31/10/2009 31/10/2010 31/10/2011 31/10/2012 31/10/2013 31/10/2014 31/10/2015 31/10/2016 31/10/2017 31/10/2018\n       FTSE All-Share Index UK consumer price\nBank of England base rate\nMost useful, of course, would be an ability to predict the future. Sadly I know I can’t do this. Also sadly, I know no-one else can either, but there are plenty out there who think they can. By all means pass them a couple of quid at a fairground for a bit of laugh, but you should otherwise keep your money well away from such fantasists.\nAll you can do is look at the facts. You may well decide that it still looks too risky to invest and, if you’re the kind of person who will panic in a sell-off, staying out may be right for you. But in a world where inflation is higher than savings rates, taking no risk is risky too - as recent FOJI victims will attest. So, as well as understanding how you’d feel if the market drops sharply in the next 12 months, you should also consider how you’d feel if it rises for the next 12 years while your cash dwindles away. From here, either scenario is possible.\n      And by quite a long way - Paul would have £180k, while Pauline would only have £111k.\nAs with most things market, these decisions are complicated by a cocktail of behavioural biases. ‘Recency Bias’ is one, being our instinct to believe the near future will look like the recent past.\nOur outsize hatred of regret is also a factor. Studies show humans will instinctively pay much more to avoid making a decision that has a regrettable outcome than we’d pay to experience a bigger positive result.\nKnowing all of this doesn’t make today’s decision any less tricky of course. So, what should investors do? Naturally, everyone’s circumstances are different, so there are no catch-all answers. A 12-year time horizon, for example, allows plenty of time to recover from the odd sell-off or two; 12 months doesn’t.\nThis document has been produced for information purposes only and does not constitute advice.

The Bank of England has warned of a 1 in 3 chance of a Brexit recession as uncertainty continues to loom. Further afield, the risks to the global economy, with heightened international trade tensions and signs of slowing growth have led the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, to cut interest rates for the first time since 2008. What’s more, we are 10 years into a global economic expansion – now the longest on record.\nNow is not the time to focus only on upside opportunities. The hour is late in the economic cycle and the risks in these uncertain times are considerable.\nWhen change is constant, what are the risks?\nFrom the dismal last quarter of 2018 to now has been a rollercoaster. We have gone from markets pricing in a global recession by this time in 2019; to a significant six month rally across asset classes, helped by monetary policy easing and the prospect of a US-China trade deal; to fears that the world’s two largest economies are readying for something much worse than a simple trade war.\nNeither side looks likely to yield until they get what they want or something gives. For the US, stock markets seem to be the pain point; for China, it’s the broader economy and access to global markets.\nOur concern is that this scrap could be more dangerous than many people have assumed. It may mark the beginning of a drawn-out de-globalisation of the global economy and its intricate value chains.\nIn any case, the current situation might get nastier before it gets better. We may need\na reaction from markets and an impact to growth before either side capitulates. We deem this reason enough to be adding robust defence to portfolios.\nImplication for portfolio positioning\nWe are naturally defensive and believe we have added to our portfolio fortifications. But we remain cautiously optimistic\nand, in our view, uncertainty is creating inconsistent pricing.\nNow the Fed has cut interest rates, bonds could revert to being more negatively\n Investors should be careful not to let seemingly positive data mask the risks arising from the lateness of the cycle, whose negative impact may take time to appear in asset prices. Even if the trade dispute is resolved, it would only be a short-term fix. De-globalisation is a long-term theme.\n "," 13\n  If investors prepare adequately, we believe they can make the most of the opportunities that uncertain markets bring.\ncorrelated to equities (which they weren’t last year). This makes them a more useful diversifier within portfolios. You could offset higher equity exposure by adding duration in markets where yields are relatively attractive and where interest rates could be cut still further in future (e.g. US Treasuries).\nOptions remain attractively priced, implying that investors see little risk of negative outcomes in the future, which is what options insure against. Cheap insurance means\nit can be cost-effective to use options to participate in market upside (if there is any) while protecting against potential downside. At present, an investor might build a case that equities could gain 20% in a year, or that they could lose 35%-40%; options are a good way of playing such an uncertain environment at relatively low cost.\nLet’s not forget how late in the cycle we are. Historically, equity markets peak about six to nine months ahead of a recession.\nEven if a recession is not imminent, it is prudent to manage a portfolio to withstand a range of risk events with the potential to transpire over the coming year.\nWe were put to the test recently in May when equities fell to -6.2%, which was the fifteenth worst monthly performance for equities over\nthe last 15 years (October and December 2018 were the thirteenth and eleventh worst months for equities.)1 During these conditions, the defence we added proved a shrewd investment as we avoided this downturn and outperformed the market by some margin.\nSimilarly, during the last risk-off period in the last quarter of 2018, we reduced the portfolio’s sensitivity to tighter monetary policy and reduced exposure in the ‘melt-up’ euphoria early in the year.\nUncertainty remains high as we move through 2019. We continue to actively manage the risk within the portfolio by focusing on our best ideas at the security level, aiming to capture the opportunities that the market still presents. Given our risk and return objectives, we believe the overall mix of exposures is\nwell diversified by sensitivity to the economic cycle, so everything should not go up or down at the same time; exposure to known risks such as the uncertainty around the US-China trade war is limited; and we are actively managing the risk behaviour of the portfolio to changing market conditions.\nThe clock keeps ticking.\nWe intend to remain steadfastly vigilant, even if everything else keeps changing.\nFor further insights about our defensive approach, please visit www.investecassetmanagement.com/DIF\nPast performance is not a reliable indicator of future results, losses may be made.

In our work with both advisers\nand fund groups, RSMR has noticed an increasing appetite for funds that broadly follow a socially responsible investment (SRI) theme and there’s no doubt that these types of funds are now becoming part of the mainstream.\nSince 2012, when RSMR launched its SRI fund rating, we’ve seen significant changes\nin this area of the market. The traditional method of ethical investing is to focus almost entirely on issues, sectors and companies that investors might wish to avoid (ie – animal testing, armaments, tobacco) and this is still an approach that’s employed successfully by some fund managers using a negative screening policy.\nIncreasingly though, we are seeing a shift towards a more positive screening approach that focuses on sectors and companies\nthat are making a positive contribution to certain environmental, social or governance factors (ESG) such as climate change, human rights or scarcity of resources. This\npositive screening approach has led to\nthe launch of a number of thematic funds that invest in companies or themes that are creating solutions to environmental or social issues. One of the growing themes of positive screening is sustainability, which is an approach that supports socially and environmentally efficient companies that operate responsible business practices.\nIn short, when it comes to SRI/ethical investing, there are a number of different approaches. This leads us on to one of the most common questions that I get asked by advisers – how can I construct a portfolio that meets the broader ethical aims of an investor while still providing a suitable level of risk?\n The one concern that’s often voiced about an ethical investment approach is that performance might be compromised, but that doesn’t have to be the case.\n ","15\n   While most of us haven’t quite reached the point of taking to the streets in protest, more and more of us are taking positive action by taking greater care in our investment choices.\nFor RSMR, it begins with asset allocation and a decision on how much to allocate to cash, fixed interest, UK and international equities and alternatives in order to fall within\nthe required risk parameters. Once we’ve completed this first part, we then populate our models with RSMR SRI rated funds.\nWe’re fortunate at RSMR in that we have\na wealth of information at our fingertips from the detailed research we’ve conducted – our SRI rated funds demonstrate strong ethical credentials and a disciplined process. And no, we won’t be fooled by the recent phenomenon of funds ‘greenwashing’ themselves.\nThis body of research provides a reasonable number of funds from which we can build different portfolios, safe in the knowledge that we not only understand how each individual fund works – but also how the overall strategy can be expected to behave based on the funds that are being blended together. This is the way that we’ve built our three discretionary SRI models, which match Synaptic risk levels 2,3 and 5.\nRSMR’s SRI ratings are freely available on the RSMR Research Hub – so advisers can use this as a resource from which to select funds for their own portfolios. But as with the\nconstruction of any portfolio, it’s important to ensure that funds are selected in a way that ensures maximum diversity – never more so than in the SRI arena where there are so many specific themes represented.\nThe one concern that’s often voiced about an ethical investment approach is that performance might be compromised, but that doesn’t have to be the case. It’s true that SRI funds might have some inherent investment biases, whether that’s at sector level (for example the avoidance of mining) or in the style of investing (SRI equity funds are generally growth orientated). Should these particular sectors or styles be out of favour then SRI funds might underperform, but conversely if the opposite were true then SRI might outperform.\nRSMR’s view is that the ability of the fund manager and the strength of the overall investment process is the key factor in determining long term returns. There’s no doubt that society is becoming more aware of the social and environmental challenges that face us, and for many investors, these considerations are beginning to inform the investment choices that they make.\nIt’s important that advisers have a suitable option to offer when faced with an investor who wants to take a more ethical approach with their investment planning. This can\nbe tackled either through the construction of some in-house portfolios (please feel\nfree to use RSMR SRI ratings to help with portfolio construction) or through the use of discretionary SRI portfolios (hint hint; RSMR has three Synaptic risk-rated models).\nWhichever route you decide to take, it’s clear that the nation’s investable assets are slowly migrating into the hands of investors who are more socially and environmentally aware. Your clients might not be stopping traffic\nat a protest, but they will increasingly be interested in where their money is invested – so be prepared.\nContact us for more details at enquiries@rsmr.co.uk or register on the RSMR Hub at rsmr.co.uk\n  ","  16\n The asset allocation conundrum:\nDo you feel lucky?\n  David Aujla | Investment Strategist | Invesco\nDavid Aujla, Investment Strategist on the Invesco Summit Growth range of funds, looks at how to avoid building binary outcomes into a portfolio.\nBy now I suspect we are all used to the question often posed at the start of every year, whether it is a new calendar year or a new tax year. The question can take different forms but it is essentially asking the same thing: Where should I invest my money this year to get the best returns?\nThe trouble is to answer that question correctly is extremely difficult. It means taking a very short-term view and also\nrelies on being right every time. That is both unlikely and unsustainable. While the upside returns potential from such an approach could well be compelling, the downside potential is much less so. It leaves investors in a binary outcome situation, with very little protection.\nReturns can vary considerably\nPicking a market that will perform well each year is no easy endeavour. Looking back over the last 15 calendar years it is clear that there have been significant differences in return between the best and worst performing asset classes globally.\n Fig 1.

At the same time it could afford them downside mitigation, greater risk-adjusted returns potential, and improved sustainability of returns that a truly diversified portfolio can bring. After all, the wider the spread across various asset classes, regions or markets, the lower the correlation between them, hence the lower the level of overall risk.\nFind out more about the Invesco Summit Growth Range at invesco.co.uk/summit\nInvestment risks\nThe value of investments and any income\nwill fluctuate (this may partly be the result of exchange rate fluctuations) and investors may not get back the full amount invested\nImportant information\nThis article is for professional clients only and is not for consumer use.

Taking a multi-asset approach means building a more diversified portfolio of assets that is less susceptible to the ‘feast or famine’ of short- term binary decisions. While this approach may mean that investors miss out on being fully exposed to the best performing asset class, region, or market in a given year, those investors also avoid the pain of being solely exposed to the worst performing ones too. This is particularly important in falling markets as demonstrated in 2018, 2011 and in 2008 (see Figures 1, 2 and 3).\n","  18\n Could we see a repeat of the 2008 crisis?\n  Patrick Boughton | Sales and Marketing Director | Clever\nDéjà vu is in my bones, I feel it like the cold chill of winter.\nIt relates to interest rates. History tells us that periods that saw unusually low interest rates followed by a period of rapidly rising rates, don’t end well. The longer the previous period of low rates, and the lower they fell, the worse the eventual crisis.\nIn the mid 1990s, the US Federal Reserve increased rates after a period when they were abnormally low. This sparked a chain of events that led to the Asian and Russian crises of 1997 and 1998 and the collapse of Long Term Capital Management. Only a bailout orchestrated by the Fed and IMF stopped the crises spreading to the West.\nArguably, the Fed, and its famous chairperson, Alan Greenspan, avoided a global crisis by creating a new bubble. This bubble developed in the early years of the 21st Century, interest rates were cut to levels that were even lower than those enjoyed in the 1990s; subprime mortgage securitisation led the way, debt surged and it all came spectacularly to a halt in 2008.\nThe crisis of 2008 was the worst crisis to rock the West since 1929. The solution: banks were bailed out, interest rates were cut to an all-time low, and stayed there for\nthe best part of a decade, and to make sure we got the point, central banks also tried to stimulate the economy by buying short- term government bonds in a process called quantitative easing, or QE.\nIt worked, sort of!\nLower interest rates and QE meant higher asset prices. Higher asset prices encouraged higher levels of borrowing, putting an\nend to the credit crunch and stimulating economic growth.\nThe danger\nBut there are dangers:\n• Record low interest rates led to an explosion in debt.\n• Rising asset prices exacerbated inequality.\n• The banking bailout created a sense of popular unease.\n• In parallel, technology has begun to hollow out the labour market, replacing well paid jobs in manufacturing with minimum wage or insecure jobs in warehouses or in the so-called gig economy.\n• We forgot the lessons of 1929.\nDebt\nEarlier this year, the IMF said:\n“Global debt is at historic highs, reaching the record peak of US$164 trillion in 2016, equivalent to 225 per cent of global GDP. The world is now 12 per cent of GDP deeper in debt than the previous peak in 2009, with China as a driving force.”\nRecently the Harvard economic professor, Carmen Reinhart, warned that Argentina, Turkey and Peru have the worse combination of current account vulnerability and poor government effectiveness, but she also suggested that Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines and India were not far behind.\nThe lessons of 1929\nOne of the self-defeating actions, following the 1929 crash, was the Hawley–Smoot Tariff, which slapped tariffs on 20,000 goods imported into the US, part of a wider, global, protectionist trend. Most economists agree that this helped prolong the 1930’s Great Depression.\nWe also saw the rejection of an international framework, such as the League of Nations.\n ","19\n   If factors over which central banks have little control create a greater inflationary risk, central banks may have no choice but to step up the pace at which they increase interest rates, creating the risk that global debt becomes unsustainable.\nPopular discontent fuelled by weak economic performance led to the rise of fascism, creating global political instability, culminating in World War II.\nRisk of a bursting debt bubble\nDebt levels may be sustainable if interest rates remain low. Although rates have been rising in the US and to a smaller extent in the UK, so far rises are modest. If factors over which central banks have little control create a greater inflationary risk, central banks may have no choice but to step up the pace at which they increase interest rates, creating the risk that global debt becomes unsustainable.\nFactors that might force the need to increase interest rates include:\n• US fiscal stimulus at a time when the US economy appears to be near full employment\n• Protectionism (reversal of globalisation).\nWarnings\nMark Carney and Gordon Brown have both warned of the risks of another 2008 style crash.\nMr Carney says that the four big risks to the global/UK economy are “those areas that have taken on a lot more debt ... risks around Brexit ... risks related to cyber security ...\nbut one of the bigger risks for the global economy are developments in China”, namely the surge in its debts.\nPositive factors\nThe fact is, in the UK, household debt to GDP is lower than in 2008. Although some emerging markets such as China, Turkey and Argentina are haunted by massive debts, the Asian tiger economies are not as indebted as they were in 1997. Besides, China is complex, and its debts are largely internal – although its debt levels are high, so are its savings.\nTechnologies, including AI, robotics, The Internet of Things, nanotechnology, genome sequencing, CRISPR, stem cell technology, additive manufacturing, virtual and augmented reality and new renewable energies, may yet prompt a period of rapid growth, nullifying many of the factors described here.\nGet in touch to book your online demo: www.cleveradviser.com/l/book-a-demo/ t: 01244 346343\ne: mail@cleveradviser.com\n In the UK, household debt to GDP is lower than in 2008.

While there is no way to guarantee performance or completely avoid being disappointed by managers, there are some key principles that we adhere to within the Fidelity Multi Asset team, which serve to help mitigate the risks of investing in actively managed funds.\nMake sure it does what it says on the tin\nAn important part of manager selection is analysing a fund’s style across the cycle. For example, if a manager has a more defensive philosophy, it is reasonable to expect them to preserve capital in difficult markets and to perhaps lag in strongly rising markets. If they were to show exceptional outperformance in rising markets or experience more drawdown than their benchmark during a selloff, this would be cause for concern as the manager has deviated from their stated aim.\nDon’t understand it? Don’t buy it\nGenerating alpha is becoming increasingly difficult, and while good managers will likely employ a wide range of tools to manage\na portfolio, the risks should be clear. This doesn’t mean that the use of derivatives\nor alternative strategies is necessarily a negative, but it is important to understand how these instruments are used.\nBeware closet indexers\nWith the rise of passive investments, buying the index is cheap and straightforward today. With that in mind, if you are employing an active manager, be sure they aren’t simply piggy-backing on the index, as there are cheaper ways to get this exposure. High active share doesn’t necessarily mean the manager is doing a good job, however, but it is one of a number of measures to monitor over time to see if a fund is being managed in line with expectations.\n If you are employing an active manager, be sure they aren’t simply piggy-backing on the index, as there are cheaper ways to get this exposure.

In addition to our analysis of quantitative factors, we also seek to understand how the lead portfolio manager engages with the broader research team,\nas well as support functions, such as risk management and compliance.\nDon’t overlook operational risk\nWe have a dedicated operational due diligence team focused on assessment of the third-party managers’ firm-wide policies and processes, ensuring that we are partnering with reliable managers. Importantly, our portfolio managers and manager research analysts have no influence over their process, and they report into the Chief Operating Officer of the multi asset team.\nContinuous monitoring and engagement\nOur job does not end after allocating capital to a manager. We view our relationship\nwith underlying managers as a business relationship, not simply a vehicle to access an area of the market. On an ongoing basis we monitor performance and meet face-to-face with management teams to ensure we are confident in continuing our relationship.\nFor more information please visit professionals.fidelity.co.uk or contact us on 0800 368 1732\n About the Fidelity Multi Asset team\nFidelity’s Multi Asset team is made up of over 90 investment professionals located across London, Paris, Hong Kong and Tokyo, with assets under management of approximately £32 billion.*\nWhat differentiates Fidelity is the quality and depth of the research team that help to support the portfolio managers.

Past performance is not a reliable\nindicator of future returns. Investors should note that the views expressed may no longer be current and may have already been acted upon.\nThe Fidelity Multi Asset funds use financial derivative instruments for investment purposes, which may expose the fund to a higher degree of risk and can cause investments to experience larger than average price fluctuations. Investments in overseas markets, changes in currency exchange rates may affect the value of an investment. The value of bonds is influenced by movements in interest rates and bond yields. If interest\nrates and so bond yields rise, bond prices tend to fall, and vice versa. The price of bonds with a longer lifetime until maturity is generally more sensitive to interest rate movements than those with a shorter lifetime to maturity. The risk of default is based on the issuer’s ability to make interest payments and to repay the loan at maturity. Default risk may therefore vary between different government issuers as well as between different corporate issuers. Sub-investment grade bonds are considered riskier bonds. They have an increased risk of default which could affect both income and the capital value of the fund investing in them. Investments in small and emerging markets can be more volatile than other more developed markets.

UKM0819/24700/SSO/NA\n ","  22\n  The art of fund screening\n Sheldon Macdonald CFA | Deputy Chief Investment Officer | Architas\nNews stories about liquidity concerns in several funds have highlighted the need for rigorous fund selection. At Architas we pride ourselves\non robust due diligence processes that can help avoid unsuitable investments. We deliberately set a high hurdle for underlying fund selection, because we only want to hold the very best funds.\nThis article explains the benefits investors in our funds gain from Architas’ five key fund selection factors:\n1. Well-resourced investment team\n2. Rigorous system of fund scoring\n3. Thorough vetting of each fund by the\nArchitas investment team\n4. Strict fund monitoring system\n5. Thorough investigation of the\noperational aspects of funds and fund houses by the Architas operational due diligence team.\nWoodford woes\nMany investors watched with concern the downturn of Neil Woodford’s Equity Income Fund. Woodford, whose long and successful track record created huge investor interest, was compelled to stop investors making withdrawals from his fund. He did so to give himself time to sell some relatively illiquid private equity assets and purchase assets that are easier to trade.\nSuch headline-grabbing stories can arouse fears among investors that they might end up trapped in underperforming funds. This is a particular risk with funds that invest\nin relatively illiquid assets, such as private equity and property.\nOur selection processes give investors\nin Architas funds the reassurance that\nevery fund we hold on their behalf has\nbeen thoroughly researched, reviewed and analysed before being chosen. Moreover, funds are monitored continuously, to ensure they remain suitable and attractive.\n1. Well-resourced investment team\nArchitas has a large investment team, in which each analyst has specialist expertise in a particular investment area, such as UK equities or emerging market debt. Portfolio managers can only buy funds recommended by the analysts and formally approved. The analysts, meanwhile, decide which funds\nthey want to propose by using quantitative and qualitative approaches.\nWe have a proprietary system of screens and filters, helping us to assess quantitatively those funds that have consistently performed well compared to peers. However, in our view, the best way to assess fund managers is to meet them and get to know their asset management approach. This more qualitative method generally gives us greater insight into what we are buying.\n2. Fund scoring\nAnalysts can’t themselves decide which funds to hold, as all funds must go through a thorough approval process. Analysts\nbring their proposed funds to the Fund Approval Forum, which comprises the entire investment team, headed by the Chief Investment Officer (CIO).\n "," 23\n  Our selection processes give investors in Architas funds the reassurance that every fund we hold on their behalf has been thoroughly researched, reviewed and analysed before being chosen. Moreover, funds are monitored continuously, to ensure they remain suitable and attractive.\nThere are three key elements to our fund analysis:\n• People: we consider the expertise, experience, stability and incentivisation of the management team of the funds we are considering\n• Process: we analyse the investment process of a fund, for example looking at how fund holdings are decided upon, and what conditions would trigger asset sales, to ensure the portfolio remains suitable\n• Performance: we look for performance that is consistently strong, and consistent with the stated style and philosophy of the fund.\nWe score funds based on these three elements, which gives us a common language when it comes to analysing\nfunds. So if someone says, ‘This is a 3 for Performance and 4 for People,’ we all broadly understand what this means. Importantly, we keep these scores updated: this is key to monitoring funds, as it allows us to identify any changes as soon as possible.\n3. Thorough vetting process\nEach analyst is responsible for covering the funds in their area. The analyst presents a fund for approval. The entire investment team sits in the Fund Approval Forum and quizzes the analyst about how the fund might meet particular objectives.\nThe Forum harnesses the collective wisdom of the team. But it recognises that the analyst is the sector specialist who knows the relevant funds better than anyone else in the team.\n4. Strict fund monitoring system\nWe have a disciplined monitoring regime. There are rules in place at the investment and operational due diligence level to ensure we stay on top of developments in funds we invest in.\nUnderperformance can often be the first indicator of problems in a fund. Any fund that triggers our underperformance warning signals must be resubmitted to the Fund Approval Forum. A decision is made to maintain the fund on the recommended list, remove it from the list, or put it on hold. We have the following rules:\n• Funds removed from the list must be sold within one month\n• Funds on hold don’t have to be sold, but further purchases cannot be made\n• Analysts can’t keep funds on hold for more than three consecutive months.\n5. Operational due diligence team\nCrucial for Architas is our strong operational due diligence process. We conduct this work ourselves, whereas some other asset management companies contract it out.\nOur due diligence team is independent from the investment team. It analyses the operational, practical aspects of investment funds and its work starts where the investment team’s work ends.\nConclusion\nOur rigorous fund selection processes are in place because we want to hold the very best funds for our investors. Even so, this does not mean we will always get our fund selection right. But our fund screening methods give investors the reassurance their investments have been thoroughly vetted, and it means they don’t have to do the vetting themselves.\nFor more information, call us on\n020 7562 4900; Monday to Friday 9.00am – 5.00pm, calls may be recorded, or visit architas.com\nThis Financial Promotion is issued by Architas.

As Abraham Lincoln once said, “The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present”.\n Higher requirements, lower returns\nWhat’s to be done? Let’s start with thinking about our clients’ needs. Their goals are changing. They face more complex and more difficult investment challenges. Their investment time horizons are lengthening.\nAt the same time, we find ourselves in a period when our expectations for future investment returns are lower. In Vanguard’s Economic and Market Outlook for 2019, our Investment Strategy Group forecast average annual nominal returns from equities over the coming ten years at 4%. If inflation is 2%, the nominal return is cut in half, leaving a 2% real return. That 2% has to bear the weight of several layers of fees, such as advice, platform and fund management charges.\nThe changing priorities of clients are already being reflected in investor behaviour. The\nflow of funds from high-cost active to low-cost passive is staggering, with sums amounting to billions of pounds a day, in the US, on Continental Europe and here in the UK. In April this year, funds across Europe saw outflows of £3.9 billion – while passive funds saw inflows of £8.4 billion1.\nA new model\nWhat then is the active model that will work in the future? How can we continue to offer our clients the benefits of active management?\nOur clients are aware of the need for value\nfor money and we need to ensure that the new model for active funds delivers. The investment debate can no longer be between low-cost passive funds and high-cost active funds. The choice for investors now has to be between low-cost passive and low-cost active.\nBut low-cost investing is not sufficient in itself to achieve clients’ goals. We need to break free of our addiction to short-term performance. Performance is important,\nof course. But we need to understand that achieving longer-term performance requires much greater depth and sophistication of analysis – of people, philosophy and process.\n Our clients are aware of the need for value for money and we need to ensure that the new model for active funds delivers.\n "," 27\n  The changing priorities of clients are already being reflected in investor behaviour. The flow of funds from high-cost active to low-cost passive is staggering.\n About Vanguard\nFounded in 1976, The Vanguard Group Inc. has grown into one of the largest fund managers in the world, with $5.6 trillion in total assets under management (as at 30 June 2019). The Vanguard Group’s unique ownership structure means it is free to focus on low costs, transparency and fairness for all clients. Vanguard has been present in Europe since 1998, opening its London office in 2009. Since that time the company has built a range of mutual funds and ETFs that bring its low-cost, high-quality ethos to investors across Europe.\nThat is where, if we are patient, sustainable performance may arise.\nActive investing is not magic – our goal is to generate appropriate returns for clients above the index, where the client is knowledgeable of, and in a position to accept, the inevitable short-term risk associated with that potential added long-term performance.\nLower fees for active management\nWe are committed to lowering the price of investing, thereby increasing the chances of investment success, for retail investors as well as institutional investors. In line with this commitment, as our funds pass their third anniversary, we have cut the annual fees on our active funds in the UK even further – to 0.48% from 0.6% in the case of our Global Equity, Global Equity Income and Global Balanced funds, and to 0.78% from 0.8% for our Global Emerging Markets Fund.\nAs Lincoln finished his speech by saying, we need not just to think anew, but to act anew. Thinking and acting anew is about innovation – but innovation is not always about technology.

After this, they can use our Central Investment Team’s asset allocation work as a framework to begin constructing their portfolio.\nThis part of the process is quite defined, and as you would expect there are lots of strict rules and controls in place to ensure consistency across all Tilney investment managers. For example, a cautious portfolio will likely look fairly similar to another cautious portfolio as they are both based on the same asset model.\nHowever, we also feel it is important to remind the client that it is their money,\nand should they wish to personalise their portfolio, the opportunity to do so is available. Our investment managers are able to accommodate client requests and deviate from our asset allocations.\nA personalised portfolio\nOften clients may want to exclude an asset class. For example, if they own a commercial property they may not want any further exposure to that asset class. Others might have a favourite sector or geographical area, for example, a recent client had a lot of business in Brazil and was confident it was going to do well so he asked for more exposure to emerging markets in his portfolio.\nUltimately, whether a client wants more or less exposure to a particular sector or asset class, it is their choice and we can usually accommodate it. We make sure the client understands that our view may be different to theirs and that the change could affect their portfolio performance.\nIncome generation is another area where we may also make changes. Clients might want a certain level of income in retirement, and we may be able to tilt the investments so the portfolio produces a higher natural level of income.\n Ultimately, whether a client wants more or less exposure to a particular sector or asset class, it is their choice and we can usually accommodate it.\n "," 29\n                          We also offer a range of model portfolios managed both on our own internal platform and across a number of the UK’s leading platforms.\nOngoing reviews\nWe are very proactive in reviewing client portfolios. We will do this when our view on an underlying fund manager changes\nor when the portfolio needs rebalancing. We also review portfolios when there are changes to our macroeconomic views and asset allocations – but we don’t always need to take any action. We have a certain tolerance around the midpoint for asset allocations and also look at the overall level of risk in a portfolio – so as long as the portfolio sits within these ranges, and the level of risk remains suitable, we may not need to do anything.\nWorking with Tilney\nAt Tilney we have been managing clients’ investments for many years, and our specialists provide discretionary investment management services for many financial advisers.

With benefit support being low and increasingly hard to access, and inadequate by not reflecting previous income, replacing any earlier quality of life is hard to address.

And it’s not just Income Protection leads. We are extending this unique service by also building a similar tool for Life, Mortgage Protection and Critical Illness product leads.\nIt is a well-known fact that selling insurance can be an uphill struggle, so a lead-generation tool such as this plays to the idea that consumers would be willing to buy protection if they were more informed about those insurers providing this type of cover and the associated premium cost.\nThe concept is simple: a customisable web application to blend seamlessly into any website, user friendly and designed to help advisers to create better financial outcomes to customers.\nOne of our customers launched the solution in April this year and has seen great results;\n1. An additional 400 consumers contact them each month for a quote and interaction with an adviser.\n2. Contributed to Webline’s Income Protection quotes (currently 59% of all Webline quotes).\n3. Helped the adviser reach out to more customers and produce better, more informed conversations around protecting consumers’ incomes to organically grow their business.\n Webline Play easily slots into any website. It is also customisable for colours, logos, number of results, even down to the page loader icon.\n ","        33\n                            It is a well-known fact that selling insurance can be an uphill struggle, so a lead-generation tool such as this plays to the idea that consumers would be willing to buy protection if they were more informed about those insurers providing this type of cover and the associated premium cost.\nOur key customer feedback so far is...\n• Synaptic offered a perfect blend of adaptability and functionality whilst developing the Webline Play system.\n• Allowing for variable inputs into the frame link, combined with the powerful quote engine sitting behind the form, allows our customers to complete the first part of their digital journey whilst also coming across as bespoke to our business.\n• Engaging with customers who have already used this system and have a quote ready is incredibly beneficial\nBeing device-agnostic, Webline Play easily slots into any website.

By shifting the focus of ‘Knowing your client’ to include alignment to a client segment, there is enormous scope for efficiencies within a firm’s day to day business practices. It is worth noting that the lang cat research demonstrates that the majority of investment onto platforms flow via CIPs. (Connection Q4 2018 edition, Steve Nelson).\nAn investment is only suitable in as much as it supports the objectives of a plan. Some financial planners have argued that\nit is their planning skills that add value, not their ability to concoct investment flavours, as much of this has little perceived value\nto the client. In fact, it is obvious in some cases that investments are chosen that are guaranteed through cost or other known factors to underperform. Asset managers are being squeezed by the uncomfortable reality of relatively low returns, requiring lower fees to allow the adviser headroom\nto charge theirs whilst being forced to be transparent with their charges in a way they never had to before.\nThis results in different types of investment that, by their nature and the compliance rules, require different due diligence processes. We work broadly with the following ‘investment pathways’: DFM/ MPS; model or bespoke portfolios; Multi- Asset Funds or I.D.D. The last reflects the more traditional approach of reliance on the product provider/insurance company\nto create investment, wrappers and governance that attract a lower bar for due diligence. The rest, however, recognise that the custody of the funds and their management will be directed by the\nfirm, who will be entirely responsible\nfor compliance. So, it’s important that compliance is accurate and streamlined, and increasingly under the new guidelines, independent (of provider or platform).\nThe qualitative considerations that led\nyou as a firm to choose the investment vehicles that make up your CIP are infinitely variable. They may reflect a minimum financial strength of the parent, a style of investment or track record of manager, proven in different parts of the economic\ncycle. It may be borne out of a conviction for passive or active investment or maybe a blend between the two. Unlike speculative or sophisticated investors, however, most retail investors should and need to be in investments that are predictable. They shouldn’t for example be tempted to invest in exotic instruments such as City Financial Absolute Equity which soared, crashed\nand then burned and is now suspended after destroying the majority of its value. Speculation is not investment.\nSo, what does state-of-the-art due diligence look like, given the above?\nThe need to be able to provide Proof of Suitability by profiling whatever investment vehicle has been selected from the CIP - for growth, risk (or loss) and cost. The more complex the portfolio the more disclosure will be required. Obviously any unpackaged solutions, including model or bespoke portfolios, can attract more administrative work and cost, including the responsibilities that come with seeking permissions and rebalancing as an advised action.\nInvestments that can be observed to perform consistently with the asset classes from which they are constructed allow you to model the likely outcomes for the\n ","     37\n                          If you can define an investment strategy that links the profiling of customers (ATRQ) with an asset allocation, it is then easy to map the objectives of your plan to a suitable investment vehicle, whose growth and loss profile matches the strategy.\noverall investment. Having a standardised model that can provide analysis of all\nretail investments will allow you to fulfil your responsibilities with PROD, but more importantly deliver financial planning consistently and efficiently. Only a probability-based model can do all of these things, and the most effective model over the years has been Moody’s (accessible\nvia the Synaptic Suite). This is thanks to the effectiveness of the rules within the engine combined with the mathematical power of the (stochastic) simulations\nthat are run to understand the viable investment outcomes. One great strength of this approach is that all outcomes\nare represented in the research, and the extent of possible losses in a bad year, similarly, are clearly defined. This allows the proof points to be delivered around\nthe traditional risk governance model: ‘Attitude to risk’ (from the psychometric questionnaire), ‘Capacity for Loss’ and ‘Need to take risk’.\nIt should be noted that the majority of\nthe industry still works with a reliance on historical volatility analysis. For several reasons, we believe this to be an inferior approach as, increasingly, volatility as a proxy for risk is being discounted by the industry (including the regulator) and stochastic methods that offer probability- based forecasts are better aligned with the compliance model.\nIf you can define an investment strategy that links the profiling of customers (ATRQ) with an asset allocation, it is then easy\nto map the objectives of your plan to a suitable investment vehicle, whose growth\nand loss profile matches the strategy.\nBelow is the current Moody’s summary output from their world famous ESG\n(or Economic Scenario Generator), the stochastic engine that provides the probability-based forecasts, creating the values to define the Synaptic risk model.\nIt demonstrates perfectly the asymmetric loss/gain returns associated with a range of strategic asset allocations (SAAs).\nIf you wish to find out more about Synaptic and Moody’s approach to risk, you can download the Synaptic Risk White Paper at www.synaptic.co.uk/risk or contact us on 0800 783 4477.\n Notes on the table above: the model shows us a ‘value at risk’ value or VAR. A VAR approach is different to drawdown or volatility metrics as it is loss over a defined period (12 months) and acknowledges the trend. This value is the extent of losses that can be expected in a bad year (1 in 20). Losses are shown to be asymmetric to gains. The third part of this risk profile is the ‘Ave gain’ which is the statistically most likely average growth rate for the term. This is the value we use as growth assumption in our cost and cash-flow analysis. The model will also show the overall outcome of the strategy we wish to analyse.\n"," CMPS 1 CMPS 2 CMPS 3 CMPS 4 CMPS 5\nMyPortfolio Index I MyPortfolio Index II MyPortfolio Index III MyPortfolio

Otherwise Synaptic Risk Ratings assume a 10 year investment horizon. You should consult Royal London directly for further information before recommending.\nAbout the service: Synaptic Risk Ratings are worked out by analysing the underlying asset classes within the fund or portfolio. Synaptic Software have requested asset allocation information from participating providers in a specific format aligned to the risk framework of the system. These asset classes are used by the model to determine the risk rating, a process that may result in a level of approximation though in most cases this will be insignificant. It is also possible that certain asset classes may not be represented exactly in the manner that providers would prefer.\nReasonable endeavours are made to provide accuracy and consistency, however neither participating providers nor Synaptic Software can be held responsible for any errors or omissions. No recommendation should be made solely on the basis of the Synaptic Risk Ratings, and additional research should be undertaken for any case. This service is intended for use by investment professionals only.\n","                       Our best ideas for your clients\n                                    Rfolios\nRSMR independently researched portfolios, risk-rated by Synaptic.\n 01535 656 555 | enquiries@rsmr.co.uk | rsmr.co.uk\nImportant Notice\nThis is intended for investment professionals and should not be relied upon by private investors or any other persons.
