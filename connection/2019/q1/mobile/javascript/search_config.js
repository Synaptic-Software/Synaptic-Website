In the modern era, risk has taken centre stage, forming\nthe basis of the suitability for the personal recommendations made by advisers of all types. MiFID II has finally set the bar at its highest level ever, where suitability must be proven at ‘Point of Sale’, but also at annual review. MiFID II also states that firms should know how their tools work:\n“... ensuring all tools, such as risk assessment profiling tools or tools to assess a client’s knowledge and experience, employed\nin the suitability assessment process are fit-for-purpose and are appropriately designed for use with their clients, with any limitations identified and actively mitigated through the suitability assessment process.” COBS9A.29EU\nWithout effective tools the adviser cannot function effectively. And without an objective measure for risk or forecast for investment growth, it is impossible to create a meaningful plan around a client’s objectives or gain ‘informed consent’. We at Synaptic believe that the forward-looking methodology of the Moody’s Analytics (Moody’s) stochastic engine offers the best framework for consistent application of risk.\nOur Paper explains some of the background to risk as the driver of investment returns and the core consideration (alongside management of costs) of retail investment management.\nThe good news is that advisers can now consider putting the Moody’s investment strategy at the heart of their risk assessments by accessing the Synaptic Risk proposition ... at our cost (so free to you).

This is basically the feeling of anxiety that an exciting event may currently be happening elsewhere:\nwhat drives people to move into the other, apparently faster-moving, supermarket queue or motorway lane.\nAs everyone knows, such action often results in that new queue grinding to a halt and the one recently vacated starting to move. And while switching queues might only end up costing a few minutes of time, such ‘grass is always greener’ tendencies can prove extremely damaging for long- term wealth generation.\nPatience is a cornerstone of our philosophy but, given the sheer amount happening in the world at present – and the 24-hour news cycle fanning the flames – it is easier said\nthan done: and strong results from many equity markets in recent years have clearly tempted many into faster-moving queues.\nTo be clear, we are not saying equity investing is the wrong way to go: equities have clearly outperformed cash and inflation, and form the bedrock of a well-diversified portfolio as the main driver of long-term returns. Another similar acronym is enough to encourage investors into equities – FOLO, or fear of losing out – with inflation eating into the value of assets held in cash.\nData on the FTSE 100 makes the attraction clearer: looking at returns going back to 1986, a one-year investment in the index at any point gives a 76% chance of a positive outcome at the end of that period (although it is important to stress the maximum possible fall has been around 50%).\nAs would be expected, the longer people are prepared to commit capital, the greater chance they get of a positive result, and a 20-year investment during the period has always yielded a positive return.\nProblems can come when investors attempt to pick between equity markets and again, some basic stats bear this out. $100 invested in the MSCI World Index just after the Lehman’s crisis in 2008 would be worth around $200 today, despite a near 50% fall in the immediate aftermath. If you tried to pick a market however, $100 invested in the MSCI USA Index would now be worth around $250 while the same amount in the MSCI World ex-USA would have given you around $150.\n While we look to add value – and maximise returns within those boundaries – via tactical allocation and fund selection, our portfolios are built specifically to avoid FOMO-type investing.\n "," 5\n  As would be expected, the longer people are prepared to commit capital, the greater chance they get of a positive result, and a 20-year investment during the period has always yielded a positive return.\nConsidering investment options back in 2008, it would have made sense to avoid\nthe epicentre of the sub-prime crisis and focus on parts of the world enjoying cleaner balance sheets – and these are exactly the kind of difficult questions investors must face if they try to pick markets. The MSCI World, a proxy for a broad equity portfolio, charts the middle path between these: not the worst or best but a solid end return without FOMO panic.\nA further layer of complexity comes when people try to time their moves into and\nout of markets: over the years, even the greatest investors have got this wrong more than right.\nAs we have said, over the long-term, equities have outperformed and we believe the best way to approach this is to imagine returns as a straight line moving upwards, from bottom left to top right on a chart. Of course, returns are not linear like this and there are plenty\nof ups and downs along the way, but if you practice what we call noise-cancelling investment, the result has been strong performance.\nThe alternative, often driven by the dreaded FOMO, is to focus too much on the volatile reality of markets and investing according to daily ups and downs can risk falling into\nirrational behaviour and making costly mistakes.\nFor us, a properly diversified multi-asset fund can take these FOMO concerns away, but this should not be taken to mean aggressive shifts into and out of asset classes: asset allocators often talk about the freedom to zero weight certain areas as a sign of an ‘active’ approach but we feel this fundamentally misses the point.\nAs Harry Markowitz – one of the pioneers of modern portfolio theory – said, diversification “is the only free lunch in finance”. While it might be uncomfortable to hold a falling asset, something else is likely to be rising at the same time and\nit is the overall blend that helps produce\na smoother performance ride over the long term. Zero weighting completely throws that out and, again, runs the risk of pandering to FOMO tendencies.\nOur multi-asset approach is target risk, meaning each portfolio is run within predetermined volatility bands and strategic asset allocation (SAA) is designed with those targets in mind. While we look to add value – and maximise returns within those boundaries – via tactical allocation and fund selection, our portfolios are built specifically to avoid FOMO-type investing.\nOur SAA will change each year to meet volatility targets, but you will never find aggressive shifts into rising markets: on\nthe contrary, we usually want to be adding exposure to areas that have done less well and are therefore cheaper, in line with a basic buy low, sell high philosophy.\nUltimately, our core message is that limiting losses as well as generating gains – what\nwe call winning by not losing – rather than chasing gains and fleeing losses, has proved an efficient way of building performance towards meeting financial goals.\nJohn Husselbee is the co-fund manager for the HC Verbatim Portfolio Growth Fund range, part of the Verbatim range of risk- managed multi-asset investment solutions.

As a result, large numbers of investors could be missing out on the investment growth they need.\nA recent survey by Aegon of more than 2,000 UK adults shows that the majority of consumers are risking financial stagnation, and investment growth well below the rate of inflation, because they worry about taking investment risk.\nConcerns about making the wrong decision when it comes to investing were cited by more than a quarter of those surveyed (28%). In addition, 12% said they were more cautious now than they were a decade ago. Yet 14% would be “more open” to taking more risk if they were told that good investment returns over the long-term meant some risk needed to be accepted.\nDespite the UK Bank Base rate averaging\njust 0.5%* each year over the last 10 years,\nit seems most savers would still prefer the perceived safety blanket of bank accounts\nto stock market investments. This lack of confidence and unwillingness to take risk means opportunities for returns above inflation are being missed. To compare, the average fund in the ABI Mixed Investment 40- 85% Shares sector returned 7.5%* a year over the same ten-year period.\nRisk should be measured\nRegardless of the current turbulent political and investment landscape, failing to take measured risk is not prudent. However, more than half of those surveyed said their appetite for risk was “low” or “zero”, preferring lower returns for minimal potential loss.\nJust 6% of people said family and friends would describe them as “risk takers”. And only 13% said they would opt for either high or adventurous levels of risk in return for high or very high long-term returns.\nKnowledge a key barrier\nAs well as a lack of risk appetite among savers, the survey suggests a poor understanding\nof investments and highlights a general\nlack of knowledge about where to turn for professional advice. 80% of those surveyed said they have not sought financial advice, while almost a third suggested they would likely rely on money influencers in the media for ideas and guidance.\n * Morningstar Direct, ten-year annualised returns of UK Base Rate and ABI Mixed Investments 40-85% Shares (pen) to 31 December 2018. Past performance is no guide to future performance.\n   "," 7\n  A recent survey by Aegon of more than 2,000 UK adults shows that the majority of consumers are risking financial stagnation, and investment growth well below the rate of inflation, because they worry about taking investment risk.\n  More than two-thirds said they would be “unlikely” to invest any extra money they have into riskier investments, such as stocks and shares, within the next year. Of those who said they are more risk-averse now than they were 10 years ago, 31% are nervous about the overall state of the global economy, a quarter (24%) have concerns that there will be another financial crash, 19% have made financial losses in the past and are now more cautious with their money, and 12% are uncertain about the best investment strategy to use.\nThis comes at a time when market volatility has been increasing in a number of markets, including the US. Many investors appear\nto be nervous about how this might affect their finances if they take on a degree of investment risk.\nGood financial advice can boost savers’ confidence\nWhile fear and uncertainty seem to be key factors holding people back from taking increased risks with their investments, their lack of understanding about the balance between investment risk and potential rewards highlights the value of good financial advice as a way to build savers’ confidence, improve their understanding of risk and to inform the right long-term investment decisions.\nWithout it, the biggest risk investors may be running is the risk that they miss out on the potential long-term rewards that investing in a well-balanced, diversified portfolio can offer.\nConversations about risk, and the use of\nrisk rating models and client suitability questionnaires have arguably never been more important or powerful as advisers help their clients understand their own attitudes to and appetite for risk.\nThe Aegon Core Portfolios range of funds are now risk rated by Synaptic to help advisers match the funds to the risk profiles of their clients.\nPlease go to www.aegon.co.uk/investments, or speak to your usual Aegon contact to find out more.\nThe information in this article is based on research among more than 2,000 UK Adults, conducted by Opinium on Aegon’s behalf in October 2018. The sample has been weighted to be nationally representative.\n  ","  8\n Platforms or SIPPs? BPS or flat fees?\n  Jessica List | Pension Technical Manager | Curtis Banks Group\nTraditionally SIPPs have been seen as bespoke products, designed solely for investors with very high fund values or for those looking to invest primarily in unusual investments. In recent years, however, the range of products marketing themselves as SIPPs has broadened considerably.\nSIPPs were already known for their flexibility, in relation to retirement options as much\nas investment opportunities, which meant they were perfectly placed to become the product of choice for taking advantage of the pension freedoms. As a result, there are now many ‘mid-market’ and ‘e-SIPP’ type products available, which tend to offer more streamlined investment solutions suitable for a much broader range of investors.\nThe traditional purpose of platforms was to give investors an easy way to hold multiple savings products in the same place: SIPPs, ISAs and GIAs – all held together. However, it seems that the reality is somewhat different, with plenty of evidence that the average platform investor holds on average considerably fewer than two products on each platform.\nTraditional usage aside, one of the big differences between most SIPP and platform pensions is the fee structure. The majority of SIPP products have a flat fee structure, whereas the majority of platforms charge percentage-based fees. We recently commissioned a pricing analysis paper by\nthe lang cat to support the launch of our new product, Your Future SIPP, and of\nthe chosen group of platforms and life companies all except one had a percentage- based fee model.\nIt’s commonly understood that percentage fees will work out cheaper for very low fund values and that fixed fees work out best for those with very large pensions. But where does that cross-over happen and is it that simple?\nOf course, the answers depend on which products you’re considering, so there are as many answers as there are combinations of products to compare. For this purpose then, we’ll use the findings from the lang cat’s paper. The first part of their price analysis focuses on funds in the accumulation stage of saving, and compares a number of pension products across the market, primarily using percentage-based charging, with a fixed fee of £260 +VAT.\nYou might be surprised to hear that the fixed fee works out about market rate for fund values of £75,000, and by the £500,000 mark it is approximately a quarter of the\nmarket rate. Looking at the same group\nof providers but including their costs for a pension in drawdown, the fixed fee model is market rate at a fund value of £200,000, and about a third of market rate by £500,000.\nAdmittedly, very few fully bespoke SIPP products will be available for that level of flat fee. However, many of the mid-market type products will be. Although relatively simple compared to their multiple-investment- account, commercial-property-holding cousins, these mid-market products are still likely to offer more investment flexibility than a platform pension, and may have other advantages over them too. For example, cost is only one of many factors, and service may be a key differentiator in the choice between a SIPP or platform pension. Many of these mid-market products will be offered by dedicated SIPP providers, meaning advisers and their clients will have access to the same levels of administration, service and support as the provider’s bespoke SIPP holders.\n ","  9\n One of the big differences between most SIPP and platform pensions is the fee structure. The majority of SIPP products have a flat fee structure, whereas the majority of platforms charge percentage-based fees.\nSIPP providers are also more likely to offer a fully flexible range of retirement benefit and death benefit options for their clients, and their staff are pension specialists. It’s certainly true that you have to take care to choose the right SIPP provider, given some of the recent headlines. Legacy issues are working their way through the industry and poor practices are being weeded out, but this means that despite the negative press, the outlook for the SIPP market is good. We believe it will emerge stronger, and well placed to continue serving the needs of pension freedoms customers. At the same time, platforms have hardly been immune from their own challenges, with many reported issues with re-platforming and reams of regulatory changes.\nOf course, there are many factors to consider with any pension and transfer decision. However, it’s worth considering that with the range of SIPPs available today, they may be valid options for people who wouldn’t traditionally be seen as SIPP investors. Is it worth thinking twice the next time you see a client with a pension fund over £75,000?\nIf you would like any more information about Curtis Banks or the Your Future SIPP, please call us on 01473 296 950 or email enquiries@curtisbanks.co.uk\n PRODUCT\n    CHARGING APPROACH\n  CORE CHARGES\n  PENSION CHARGES\n   DRAWDOWN CHARGES\n  Curtis Banks Your Future SIPP\n  Fixed-fee\n £260 + VAT for investment partner list, £560 + VAT for full investment range.\nPension only\n  £120 + VAT for designating funds, £150 + VAT per annum for income.\n Prudential Retirement Account\n    Stepped %\n   Steps down from 0.45% to 0.25%\n    Royal London Pension Portfolio\n  Stepped %\n Steps down from 0.90% to 0.35%\n  £199 one off drawdown fee (removed if plan in force for over 12 months)\n Scottish Widows Retirement Account\n   Stepped %\n  Steps down from 0.90% to 0.10%\n  Aegon Retirement Choices (ARC)\n    Tiered %\n  From 0.60% to 0.45% capped at £1,215 pa\n     £75 annual fee\n  AJ Bell Investcentre\n  Hybrid\nFrom 0.20% to 0.10%\n   Between £30 to £50 quarterly charge + VAT depending on fund value.

So, in my last column I hinted that this time round I’d be taking a look at what the future of portfolio management on platforms might have in store. Consider this a sequel then. Or the difficult second album. They’re always just as good, right?\nAwkward. Anyway, in my last column for the fine people at Capita, I took a swift look at the main methods of Centralised Investment Proposition (CIP1) construction on platforms and I shared my views on some of the pros and cons of each method. Now, I’m going to turn that on its head and take a punt at what the future might have in store and how some things may change.\nPredictions are a tricky business to get right (although, I’ve long since stopped betting on Scotland to qualify for anything) but the truth is that if you ground them in enough common sense and stretch out the timeframe long enough then no-one can possibly hold you to account. Bonus! That’s a top class consultancy technique that you can have for free.\nI jest of course. Let’s cut to the chase and have a look at three things which I think the future might have in store.\nBuilding a wall between financial planning and investment management\nNo, not that kind of wall. We’re not trying to make platforms great again, they’re alright as they are. It’s a metaphor, innit.\nWhat we see is that lots of firms have different people within the same firms running elements of the house model portfolio framework. This can create a series of unfortunate events with permission and\nrebalancing issues causing a long trail of version control dead. Frankly, if you were to build the UK financial services sector from the ground up, this situation would simply not exist.\nIn short, I reckon running advisory models and investment management functions under the same roof at any kind of scale doesn’t\nfeel sustainable to me. Doing it properly will require either discretionary permissions, outsourcing or a watertight series of processes and controls.\n I reckon running advisory models and investment management functions under the same roof at any kind of scale doesn’t feel sustainable to me. Doing it properly will require either discretionary permissions, outsourcing or a watertight series of processes and controls.\n1 We know from our various items of research that CIPs are the centre of gravity for platform business which is why we talk about it so much. 86% of respondents to our November 2018 State of the Adviser Nation study (235 respondents) state that they run a CIP\n "," 11\n            What we see is that lots of firms have different people within the same firms running elements of the house model portfolio framework. This can create a series of unfortunate events with permission and rebalancing issues causing a long trail of version control dead.\nUltimately, I’m betting that the market might polarise to the point that advisory models in the truest sense are generally found only in small specialist operations or in firms where functions are separated. We’re already seeing tonnes of adjacent evidence in the market where many financial planners, particularly in the next generation, are favouring behavioural financial planning over tinkering with investment products.\nTech will make things better\nWell, of course tech will get better because that’s what tech does. Slow down Nostradamus!\nIn the longer term, Blockchain and distributed ledger technology has the potential to be a huge disruptor in financial services making lots of processes much easier (AML, onboarding, suitability et al), reducing the admin burden, building and storing client profiles which in turn will drive better client segmentation.\nIn the shorter term, we’re going to see some very clever algorithms from some very, very clever people delivering tweaks and enhancements to current processes and practises. While we understand the drive towards industrialised, commoditised CIPs, current practise leaves little wiggle room for individualisation.\nI reckon in the short to medium future we’ll see more developments around tailoring for individual needs. Think stuff around tax- optimisation and individualisation (e.g. ethical overlays) of otherwise off-the-shelf portfolios. Some of this kit is hitting the shelves now. It’ll soon be the standard.\nA problem for the ages\nI’ll win no awards for pointing out the potential implications and concerns of an ageing market for individual advice. Why I’m doubling down on this concern is how this squares up with the current accepted wisdom around safe withdrawal rate theory + drawdown + cash management being the vehicle of choice for retirement portfolio management.\nWhile I can get on board with much, if\nindeed all, of this thinking, I have two recurring worries: (1) What happens to the small minority of customers for whom the safe withdrawal rate pans out as being less than safe and (2) how is the sector going to (efficiently) service an ageing population who, in the nicest and politest sense, may not wish to be serviced in their twilight years.\nWhat could tip the balance? Annuities\nwill continue to play a role and we may\nsee another generation of sophisticated guaranteed income products (including products that offer flexibility with some element of guarantee). Data and technology will drive the market here. Guarantees may become more affordable as the industry harnesses the power of big data to design better products.\nMore obviously, technology will enable income sustainability kit. Algorithms that\ncan analyse investment performance in the context of risk and objectives will enable portfolios to be managed, work seamlessly with the cash management aspect of platform tech, be rebalanced and more easily reviewed. This paradigm doesn’t exist yet, but it will.\nDystopia/utopia?\nSo, there we have it. Three things that may or may not happen at an arbitrary point in the future. But let’s close our eyes, say a collective prayer to our deity of choice and imagine\na post-Brexit utopia where it matters little whether that nerdy guy from that Scottish consultancy with the weird name was right or not. You’ll be too content to care.\nVisit www.langcatfinancial.co.uk for more from Steve and the rest of the lang cats.\n ","  12\nUS Fed policy update: A single rate hike likely in 2019\n Joe Davis, PhD | Global Chief Economist | Vanguard\nAnxious investors, take heart: The US Federal Reserve hears you.\nPolicy uncertainty and market volatility\nof late have prompted us to revise our expectations for the Fed’s target for short-term interest rates in 2019. Our new baseline forecast is for a single additional rate increase, the tenth since December 2015 and perhaps the final hike of the current monetary-policy cycle. It represents a change from the 2019 outlook we published last month.\nTo be sure, Fed policymakers themselves have signalled in recent days a willingness\nto reconsider their path forward. Not long ago that path included as many as three expected rate hikes this year. The latest forecast from the Fed’s policy-setting Open Market Committee anticipates a pair of 2019 rate increases. Meanwhile, bond investors\nin aggregate now suspect the Fed will stand firm, keeping its current target of 2.25%– 2.5% in place for a while. Thus our revised baseline estimate of a one-more-and-done approach to rate-setting this year puts us inbetween the Fed’s own crystal ball and that of the bond market.\nMarkets underestimated the Fed in 2018 and are doing so again for 2019\n   Notes: The historical federal funds rate indicates the midpoint of the target range. Market forecasts reflect implied pricing from federal funds futures. Data are as at 31 December 2018.\nSources: Vanguard, Bloomberg, and the Federal Reserve.\n  "," 13\n We expect the Fed to hold its rate target steady for several months before raising rates, likely in June. Our forecast of the risk of US recession in this scenario now stands at 35%, up marginally from 30% in the outlook we issued last month.\n To treat the future with the deference it deserves, however, we believe economic\nand market forecasts should be expressed in terms of probabilities. We don’t pretend that only one outcome can occur. Instead, we consider baseline, or most likely, scenarios, as well as potential outcomes to the upside and downside. Here are our revised expectations:\n• Baseline: The Fed will hike rates just once in 2019. Our revised expectation\nis based on an analysis of current policy uncertainty and anticipates that the current level of financial market volatility will persist through the first quarter.\nIn this case, the likelihood that market volatility will dent the real economy – the production of goods and services and their consumption – is high. We expect the Fed to hold its rate target steady\nfor several months before raising rates, likely in June. Our forecast of the risk of US recession in this scenario now stands at 35%, up marginally from 30% in the outlook we issued last month.\n• Upside: Policy uncertainty and market volatility significantly recede before the end of the first quarter. In this case, there’s a higher likelihood that the Fed will raise rates twice this year, as we initially forecast. A second hike would\nlift the Fed’s target to 2.75%–3.00%.\nThis was our baseline scenario in early December, but given recent conditions we now view it as the upside.\n• Downside: Policy uncertainty and market volatility persist through the first half of the year. In this scenario, economic fundamentals are likely to be damaged and the Fed is likely to take a pass on any additional rate hikes. If the Fed does not raise rates by mid-2019, their window of opportunity could close and the next change in the target rate would likely be a reduction.\nWhile we’ve revised our outlook for Fed policy, our investment outlook remains unchanged. Several factors will raise the risk of recession this year, but a slowdown in growth, led by the United States and China, is the most likely outcome. We also forecast:\n• Periodic growth scares, sparking elevated levels of market volatility.\n• Inflation remaining in check, in the\nrange of 2% or less, but an escalation in tariffs, oil prices or wages could alter that outlook. Even if price increases accelerate, however, our research shows that inflation-caused recessions have become rarer as a result of more proactive central bank action and anchored inflation expectations.\n• US economic growth likely to decline toward 2% this year amid declining support from federal tax and spending policies and continued monetary policy normalisation. Higher wages are unlikely to funnel through to consumer prices.\nFor additional perspective on what the future may hold for investors, please see ‘Vanguard economic and market outlook\nfor 2019: Down but not out’ at https:// www.vanguard.co.uk/documents/adv/ literature/vg-economic-outlook-2019.pdf\nImportant risk information:\nThe value of investments, and the income from them, may fall or rise and investors may get back less than they invested.

Investors need to do more than simply buy and hold.\nLast year was a tough year for investors: a lot of assets went down and relatively few went up. This was in spite of significant optimism at the start of the year as synchronised global growth and US tax cuts buoyed investor sentiment. It concluded in one of the weakest Decembers in recorded history.\nFrom here, says John Stopford, Head of Multi-Asset Income at Investec Asset Management, his team is asking itself a number of questions: Was that it? Is the correction over and will markets resume their bull run? Or is it the beginning of another bear market? In this scenario, any rally would be a selling opportunity rather than a buying opportunity. He says there are arguments on both sides.\nThere are plenty of reasons for caution, he suggests: “It is late in the business cycle and there does not appear to be a lot of upside for growth assets such as equities and corporate debt. Unemployment figures\naround the world are low; this is a late cycle phenomenon and suggests there is not a lot of spare capacity.”\nOn the other hand, Stopford argues, below trend growth doesn’t equal a recession. The yield curve is showing a probability of\nrecession by 2020, but it remains an outside possibility for 2019, which means growth can keep going through to the middle of next year. Monetary policy is a major factor. Even though interest rates haven’t gone up a lot, Stopford says there is an argument that policy support is being removed too quickly.\nHe says: “The central banks seem to be\non autopilot and are much less inclined to respond to market weakness in this part of the cycle. As such, they are quite likely to continue to shrink their balance sheets and continue with quantitative tightening.\nThe central banks don’t want to reignite debt growth and that means they can’t ease policy as aggressively as they have done\nin the past. It seems like things have to get worse before they will get material support from central banks.”\nChina is also a concern. The data is clearly weakening, with the country’s manufacturing tipping into contraction territory at the end\n The central banks seem to be on autopilot and\nare much less inclined\nto respond to market weakness in this part of the cycle. As such, they are quite likely to continue to shrink their balance sheets and continue with quantitative tightening.\n "," 15\n  The yield curve is showing a probability of recession by 2020, but\nit remains an outside possibility for 2019, which means growth can keep going through to the middle of next year.

China is also held back by the trade war. He says: “There are reasons for both China and the US to get together and do a deal. However, their differences relate to economic power. The US has a legitimate concern that China has taken advantage\nof trade rules and helped itself to US intellectual property to push itself forward.\nThis is about who will be the biggest dog in the pack for the next 30 years.” This is not\na question that resolves itself overnight.\nIn the meantime, the Chinese government has announced some easing measures, but the government is still worried about the country’s debt burden and is unlikely to turn the taps on significantly. Elsewhere fiscal easing looks unlikely. The boost from the US tax cuts will fade this year and with the Democrats in control of the House, further cuts look unlikely.\nEurope is constrained by the EU rules. Corporate health says Stopford is also waning: “Earnings revisions are becoming more negative and buybacks are fading, particularly as bond yields have risen.”\nOn the other hand, it is plausible that earnings and growth will stabilise or the Federal Reserve will slow quantitative tightening. This would resolve some uncertainty and provide a boost for risk\nassets. How is he managing this environment in his portfolios: “The way we think about the world is different: unlike a typical multi- asset manager, we believe it is difficult to\nget big picture asset allocation calls right. The biggest opportunities lie in selecting individual securities. There are 25,000 individual securities, and we aim to build a portfolio of around 250.”\nStopford and his team look for those securities with certain characteristics aligned to the outcome of the Diversified Income Fund: “That is income with capital stability, low volatility and limited drawdowns. We want the income to be sustainable and resilient. In this portfolio, income does the heavy-lifting. We look for strong balance sheets and income in excess of what is necessary.”\nOnce he has found those securities, he looks at how they can be blended for resilience. “We make sure we’re properly diversified. Diversification by sensitivity to economic growth, for example, or interest rates. We are looking at behavioural characteristics not asset classes.”\nAs such, the group’s asset allocation discussions are not the typical ‘bonds versus equities’. At the moment, for example,\nhe is buying call options for the portfolio,\nwhich look cheap given the insurance they provide. He adds: “Volatility is likely to be an important factor this year, both in economies and in markets. There are growing risks to the business cycle. That said, there will be opportunities as well. We want to make sure we capture both sides.”\nTo find out more about the Investec Diversified Income Fund, including its track record of minimising losses during extended bouts of volatility, please visit www.investecassetmanagement.com/DIF\nInvestment involves risks.

Until recently, some of us have been guilty of ignoring the repercussions of where we have chosen to invest our money and been predominantly focused on one thing: financial return. But what if your investments could generate competitive financial returns and also be used to improve the health of our planet and the wellbeing of the global community?\nThe reality is that sustainable investing\nis going to become ‘mainstream’. Once synonymous with negatively screening\nfor ‘sins stocks’ i.e. tobacco, alcohol, adult entertainment, armaments and gambling, investing with an awareness of global challenges is gaining new found popularity. Sustainable investing now sees investors demanding options that align with their personal values and prioritise environmental, social and governance factors whilst not sacrificing financial return. The socially responsible investing (SRI) market is now estimated to be worth almost $23 trillion globally, with around half of all assets managed in Europe and a third in the\nUnited States. Staggeringly, the growth of Environmental, Social and Governance metrics (ESG) assets in the US is up over 200% over the past decade.1\nThe options available for clients are growing at an unprecedented rate across all asset classes, as are the number of related indices. The growing consensus across the market over the past few years is that a strong performance across ESG can be a representation of operational excellence. Companies that make a conscious effort\nto tackle issues such as resource waste\nand employee working conditions usually translate these ESG returns into financial ones. Even during economic downturns,\nan ESG focus can enhance performance as factors such as good governance can feasibly result in lower corporate risk. When one compares traditional equity indices to the MSCI ESG-focused alternatives, it is clear that since 2012, annualised returns for ESG indices have matched or indeed exceeded their counterparts across developed and emerging markets.2\nSustainable equity portfolios that feature companies that have a strong ESG focus have the potential to outperform the market in the long-term. Sustainable investing can give investors an edge to mitigate risk and, in some cases, deliver outstanding long-term returns.3\nSocially responsible investing is not a new phenomenon but, despite its growth, it has traditionally been a niche part of the market. 2019 may be the year where that all changes. Last year, the government released a report entitled ‘Growing a Culture of Social Impact Investing in the UK’.4 The report outlines\nkey recommendations to help encourage the growth of investing that has a positive impact on society as well as producing positive financial returns. Whilst the report focuses on a small aspect of sustainable investing, it signifies the wider change in\n "," 17\n  Sustainable investing now sees investors demanding options that align with their personal values and prioritise environmental, social and governance factors whilst not sacrificing financial return.\nthe public’s attitude to investments and shows the UK Government’s clear political commitment to supporting the market this year.5\nA second indicator of sustainable investing’s advance towards being considered ‘mainstream’ is the increasing growth of fixed income ESG product innovation. Bloomberg has reported that the supply of ‘green bonds’ (bonds that are issued to raise money to tackle specific environmental challenges) is expected to increase more than 60% on 2017 from $155 billion to $250 billion. Of course, when compared to the world’s total bond market of nearly $100 trillion, this seems inconsequential, but issuance growth in 2017 and 2018 across all categories remains encouraging.6\nLong-term thinking is a critical part of\nESG and sustainable investing. The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\ncan be utilised as a framework for guiding investments that make a positive societal and environmental impact.7 The 17 SDGs were adopted in 2016 by all 193 UN member states to work towards a better future for all.8 The goals comprehensively detail targets and provide tangible indicators of impact to address global challenges such as climate change, education and healthcare. The\nUN estimates that it will require between $5 trillion and $7 trillion dollars a year to achieve the goals by 2030.9 Crucially, in developing countries alone, the annual investment gap in major SDG sectors is estimated at $2.5 trillion a year.\nFurthermore, with the current levels of private sector participation, there will be\na shortfall of $1.6 trillion to be covered by the public sector.10 Evidently, a significant acceleration of private investment in SDG sectors is required to aid the UN in meeting its targets. The long-term framework that the SDGs provide has encouraged us at LGT Vestra to engage with investments that not only have a deeply engrained ESG ethos or impact initiative, but investments that also encourage progress by supporting companies that show a measurable engagement with the SDGs.\nTogether, small changes can have a large impact\nWe are delighted to have our newly launched Sustainable Model Portfolio Service (SMPS) risk rated by Synaptic Risk.

Ibid.\n  ","  18\n Active investing – passive pricing\n Mark Parry | Director | Head of Distribution Partners | BMO\nLaunched in late 2017, the BMO Universal MAP Range brought something new to the funds marketplace – a suite of actively managed risk-targeted options that, with an Ongoing Charge Figure capped at 29 basis points, come at a price usually associated with passive investing.\nIn many ways, today’s investors find themselves in an enviable position compared with that of their predecessors. There is greater choice in terms of asset types, product providers and individual funds. Investing is easier thanks to technology, meaning you can select, monitor and\nadjust your portfolio, often instantly. It’s\nalso increasingly cost-effective, with a real downward trend in the prices associated with investment. The latter is important as lower costs means less of a drag on returns and greater scope for achieving the outcomes investors are looking for.\nNonetheless, it remains the case that the value of investments can go down as well as up and investors may not get back the original amount invested.\nProven principles\nDespite these changes, many of the principles associated with sensible investing are as applicable today as they have been in the past.\n✓ Diversification – spreading your portfolio across a range of investments\n✓ Long-term thinking – riding out shorter- term challenges and fluctuations\n✓ Consider valuation – remembering that the price you pay for an asset is a key determinant of its long-term potential.\nThe push to passive\nIt’s unsurprising, therefore, that many of today’s more popular investment options emphasise the benefits of diversification etc alongside the obvious advantages of lower costs. The latter has seen passive strategies proliferate, with individuals now able to access portfolios investing across a host of asset classes in a cost-effective manner through products like Exchange Traded Funds.\nActive benefits\nWhilst great news from a price perspective, those choosing to allocate to passively managed strategies are, by default, forgoing the potential benefits associated with active\nmanagement. The advantages of active investing are multi-faceted in nature.\n• Asset allocation – making active adjustments to a portfolio’s overall asset mix to reflect economic and market conditions. For example, if the economy\nis growing, a greater emphasis on equities may be sensible, whereas in more challenging conditions it may be prudent to favour the more resilient characteristics of fixed income. Exposure to individual countries can also be adjusted to reflect geographic differentials between regions and countries.\n• Tactical moves – alongside strategic asset allocation, it does make sense to think tactically too – taking advantage of more time sensitive opportunities and navigating near-term risks. Markets can move fast so a tactical overlay has scope to add real value.\n• Stock picking – the way components – such as individual equities or bonds – are selected can have a big impact as the\n "," difference between the winners and losers can be stark. In January 2018 for example, Carillion plc became the largest ever trading liquidation in the UK – bad news for its employees, customers and shareholders. If outperformance is the desired outcome, then doesn’t it make sense to invest on the basis of detailed company analysis rather than passively mirroring the composition of a stock market index?\n• Risk management – any investment involves a degree of risk, so assessing\nand managing this is a big part of any active strategy. A market may be looking expensive, for example, so taking steps to protect the portfolio may be prudent.\nBMO Universal MAP funds –\nan active solution at a passive price point\nIt’s with these factors in mind that we developed the BMO Universal MAP Range, launching the funds in late 2017. We recognised the desire for a well-diversified portfolio building block at an attractive price but felt that cost considerations were leading individuals down a wholly passive route, which in turn meant forgoing the potential benefits of active management.\nThe range is built on firm foundations – we’ve been managing multi-asset portfolios for many years and used a proven multi-asset platform together with our other specialist capabilities to deliver a suite of actively managed funds at a price point typically associated with passive funds. For investors seeking attractive long-term returns and an investment aligned with their attitude to risk, the BMO Universal MAP funds offered a new and unique option.\nA good start\nIt’s worth noting that 2018 was an eventful and challenging year for markets and the team managed to add value through strategic asset allocation, tactical adjustments and bottom- up stock selection. Although the funds are little over a year old, we are pleased with how they have performed so far relative to their peers (the IA Volatility Managed).\nTeamwork – the BMO Universal MAP funds are managed by the BMO Multi-Asset team.

The recent market volatility may exacerbate these issues and lead to investors suffering far worse outcomes than they should. Advisers have an important and valuable role in helping their customers avoid or mitigate these issues.\nThe behaviour gap\nMuch of economic theory is based on the belief that individuals behave in a rational manner and that all existing information is included in their investment process.\nResearchers continue to provide evidence that rational behaviour is often lacking. The study of behavioural finance attempts to understand and explain how human emotions influence investors in their decision-making process.\nWhile there is a debate about how best to measure the gap between the return we should achieve and that which our poor behaviour delivers, there is little doubt about whether it exists and what causes it. Estimates put the behaviour gap between just over 1% and over 4% (though there\nis dispute at the efficacy of the latter’s methodology), see chart1.\nFigure 1 - Estimates of the behaviour gap\n Source: Betterment\n "," 21\n  So how irrational are we?\nHere is a quick summary of some of the behavioural theories and their impacts.\nA. Regret theory\nRegret theory deals with the emotion people experience after realising they’ve made an error in judgment. Faced with the prospect of selling a fund, investors become affected by the price at which they purchased the fund. They avoid selling it to avoid the regret of having made a bad investment, as well as the embarrassment of reporting a loss.\nRegret theory can also impact investors when a fund that they had considered buying has increased in value – the feeling of having missedout.\nB. Mental accounting\nHumans tend to place events into ‘compartments’ and the difference between these compartments sometimes impacts our behaviour more than the events themselves e.g. the hesitation to sell an investment that once had large gains and now only has a small gain.\nC. Prospect/loss-aversion theory\nProspect theory suggests people express\na different degree of emotion towards gains than towards losses. Individuals are more distressed by prospective losses than they are happy from the same size gain – advisers don’t get calls when portfolios rise by £100,000 but they do when they fall by £100,000!\nProspect theory also explains why investors hold onto losing funds: they often take more risks to avoid losses than to realise gains. Gamblers on a losing streak will behave in\na similar fashion, doubling up bets to try to capture what’s already been lost.\nD. Anchoring\nIn the absence of better or new information, investors often assume that the market price is correct. People tend to place too much credence in recent market views, opinions and events, and mistakenly extrapolate\nrecent trends that differ from historical, long- term averages and probabilities.\nE. Overreacting\nInvestors become very optimistic when the market goes up, assuming it will continue\nto do so. Conversely, investors become overly pessimistic during downturns. A consequence of anchoring or placing too much importance on recent events, while ignoring longer term data, is an over- or under-reaction to markets. So, we see prices falling too much on bad news and rising too much on good news.\nF. Overconfidence\nPeople generally rate themselves as being above average in their abilities (apparently 90%ofusbelievethatwearebetterthan average drivers!). They also overestimate\nthe precision of their knowledge and their knowledge relative to others. Overconfidence results in excess trades, with trading costs eroding performance.\nG. Reaching for yield\nSince the global financial crisis, interest rates have been at historic lows and there is growing evidence that these low interest rates increase investors’ appetite for risk taking, a phenomenon referred to as “reaching for yield”.\nWhat can advisers do to help?\nThe key role of the financial planner/fiduciary is to be aware of these issues and to help coach investors (and themselves!) through these issues. And to employ strategies to assist.\n1. Setlongtermgoals–usecashflow models to help and show clients what a 20% fall looks like in £s terms. Make it real for them so when it happens, they are ready.\n2. Keepaneyeoncosts-Morningstar found that the best predictor of fund performance is fees, simply because paying too much directly erodes your performance and directly contributes to the behaviour gap. It’s wholly possible for\nan uneducated investor to overpay by 1% or more for a product and another 1% for their platform.\n3. Tradeinfrequently(andcosteffectively) – use pre-funding and free switching on platforms to rebalance.

Beawareofclientbiases-aclientwho has experienced five years of 10% annual returns is likely to expect that going forward, when the reality is likely far less appealing than that.\n6. Finally, despite every effort at inoculating clients against bad behaviour, it’s inevitable that some are going to panic in volatile times, which is where your just-in-time reassurance, support and advice come in.\nThe future\nThe way we are wired as humans has ensured our survival as a species over tens of thousands of years, but it turns out to be a considerable hindrance in our ability to run investment portfolios effectively. There is a clear and valuable role for advisers to help customers close the behaviour gap and flourish - perhaps that’s why we are seeing\na rise in robo-advisers - if humans are poor when it comes to investing we should let the robots take over?\nFor more information please drop me a line.

It’s probably unfair to use the oft quoted ‘pin sticking’ analogy, but there was certainly a culture where research was largely limited to a flick through the life and pensions supplement of a particular trade publication.\nThankfully, most would agree that we’re\nin a much better place now. Post-RDR, the majority of firms have adopted some form\nof standardised process for matching clients with a suitable product or service – helped in large part by the increased use of back office systems, risk profiling software and platforms.\nBut just as many firms were settling down into the broad use of a CIP, along came MiFiD II (which caused much consternation throughout 2018) and Prod. Worryingly, studies show that over half of UK advisers are unaware of the full implications of Prod. We will return to the impact of Prod in future articles but for now it does seem like a good time to set out some basic best practice principles on how to build and monitor a centralised investment proposition.\nThe primary benefit of a well-designed CIP\nis that it creates a consistent and repeatable approach, which should produce better outcomes for investors. It should also enable a firm to operate more efficiently – with more time dedicated to offering clients the level of service that demonstrates value for money. It\ngoes without saying that if the CIP is operated robustly and is well documented, then the regulatory risk to a business is significantly reduced.\nSo where do you start? The first questions would usually relate to the philosophy that a firm adopts and the tools that it uses. This should be documented to form the basis\nof a client service proposition. Common questions are;\n• Am I independent or restricted?\n• How do I consider risk and discuss\ncapacity for loss?\n• What is my approach to asset allocation? • What type of clients do I deal with?\nAnd how do I segment them into\ndefined categories?\n• How do I research and select solutions\nto match the requirements of each client segment?\nHaving a structured advice process, containing several stages that are each underpinned by a robust methodology, will set your firm apart from the competition and help you to target\nthe type of clients who see the value in the services that you offer.\nThis is the bread and butter for advisers. Increasingly, many are introducing lifestyle and life planning questionnaires into the process along with cash-flow modelling software tools, seeking to respond to the increasing sophisticated client needs and to differentiate their service from the competition.\nAttitude to risk\nAdvisers use a variety of tools to determine\na client’s attitude to risk and increasingly these involve more scientific approaches such as psychometric testing and questioning techniques, but there is no substitute for\na good old fashioned discussion with your client where you can probe and challenge their attitude to risk and their understanding of the impact of market volatility on their investments. This area is fundamental to establish client understanding, another part of TCF, and needless to say this must all be recorded on the client file.\n  "," 23\n  Robust research & analysis | Documented methodology | Due diligence | Full audit trail\n Jon focuses on key relationships with RSMR’s existing and new advisory client firms.

In setting asset allocation it is necessary to do this at a strategic level, based on the client’s appetite for risk over the longer term, meeting the client’s expectations as determined by the risk profiling exercise. Some form of tactical overlay may then be considered to respond to shorter term shifts and trends in the market, but the strategic position should remain the starting point.\nFund selection/portfolio construction\nThis is an equally important stage of your investment advice process and you should ensure you choose funds based on a combination of quantitative and qualitative factors. The quantitative measures centre on performance and risk with a number of measures used in each area to provide a comprehensive picture.\nThe qualitative assessment of any fund is to assess how the fund will perform in the future. The purpose of this part of the analysis is\nto ensure that the fund has robust fund management processes in place and a strong fund management team, and the qualitative\nThis is one in a series of articles around CIPs and PROD.\nContact us for more details at enquiries@rsmgroup.co.uk or register onto the RSMR Hub at www.rsmr.co.uk\n©RSMR 2019.

And there are lots of reasons why people are reluctant to buy the protection they need. In our industry, we’ve talked for years about how to combat the common objections – ‘it’s too expensive’, ‘I don’t need it’, ‘the State will provide’ and all the other excuses people come out with. But in concentrating on the obvious objections, have we possibly missed the most fundamental?\nWe know customers find protection products too complicated to understand and, more importantly, they don’t trust us to pay out when they claim on their policy.\nOf course, the reality is that as an industry we do pay claims. In fact, we do everything we can to make sure we do. But still customers don’t believe it. Even sharing our claim statistics isn’t helping. At Guardian we believe the way to really shift customer perception is to change the way protection policies are designed.\nComplexity creates doubt in people’s minds. Removing complexity from protection products, making it simpler for customers\nto engage with their policies as their needs develop over time and should they ever need to claim, is the key to improving customer perceptions.\nHere are just five examples of how protection proposition design can help\nyou create more meaningful long-term relationships with your clients, giving them reasons to return to you for advice.\n1. Our clear critical illness definitions give your clients certainty\nWe’ve used language that’s easy for you to explain and for your clients to understand. This way, your clients will be clear about what they’re buying so that when they come to make a claim, they won’t need to worry about not meeting the definition. And we won’t need to disappoint them because they’ve not had a ‘serious enough’ heart attack for example.\n Payout Planner allows your clients to nominate up to nine beneficiaries easily when they apply – and update them anytime. This means any payout is excluded from their estate, so it bypasses probate and goes straight to loved ones without delay.\n "," 25\n  Complexity creates doubt in people’s minds. Removing complexity from protection products, making it simpler for customers to engage with their policies as their needs develop over time and should they ever need to claim, is the key to improving customer perceptions.\nBut we’ve not just made the wording in our definitions as simple as we can – for as many conditions as possible, we only need confirmation from a UK Consultant rather than asking for detailed medical evidence. They’re the experts, after all.\n2. Payout Planner means no more probate delays\nProbate can delay a payout from reaching the family when they need it most. Placing policies in trust is one way to avoid this of course, but trusts are complex and time- consuming to set up.\nPayout Planner allows your clients to nominate up to nine beneficiaries easily when they apply – and update them anytime. This means any payout is excluded from their estate, so it bypasses probate and goes straight to loved ones without delay.\n3. Reserved Cover makes increasing or adding new cover effortless\nSetting up home is expensive, which\nmeans the price of protection is a barrier\nfor many people when you add it to the\ncost of moving and the monthly mortgage repayments. Because of this, most people protect their mortgage with life cover alone, so they have no protection against the bigger risk of critical illness.\nHowever, we automatically reserve cover for your clients, when we can, above and beyond what you ask for. This makes it easy for\nyour clients to get the protection they can afford today, and increase it tomorrow when they’re better able to afford it.\nUsing this reserved cover, you can increase their Life Protection or add – or increase – Critical Illness Protection anytime within the first 27 months, on the same terms, just by answering a few simple questions.\n4. We include Premium Waiver at no extra cost, for everyone\nWaiver of premium is usually an optional add-on which means if your clients don’t take it, they could quickly find their premiums become a burden when they can least afford them.\nHowever, with us, Premium Waiver comes as standard – at no extra cost – regardless of age, occupation or activities. So, if we offer someone cover they automatically get waiver. And we not only waive premiums if they’re too ill to work, we also waive them for up to 6 months after they have a baby or if they lose their job.\n5. Our dual life option keeps policies separate so couples are better protected\nUsually, if a couple applies for cover together and one claims, the other is left uninsured.\nOur dual life cover, on the other hand, gives both of them their own individual cover, at a discount. This means that if one claims, the other is still covered. And if their relationship ends, their cover doesn’t because their policies are separate.\nWe only offer dual life because we don’t believe joint life policies are fair.\nThese are just five good reasons to consider our cover. But there are plenty more, because we’re always looking for a better way.\nThe Guardian proposition is live on the Synaptic Product & Fund Research tool.

Prices are all in the same ballpark, give or take a few pounds. And\nthe vast majority of claims – 97.8% in 2017, in fact – are paid out without problems.\nSo, with all else being relatively equal, it’s the things beyond these factors which can help determine which policy is going to be the best fit for your client and their loved ones.\nFor instance, is it a brand you and your client trust? How quickly and smoothly can you get the business written? How comprehensive\nis the cover? And – importantly – are there any extras that could give your client further reassurance and support?\nDig for treasure\nSeveral providers now offer a package of extras bundled with their protection policies. And some of the biggest differences between policies can be uncovered if you look at which specific extras are actually included with them.\nAt Aviva, for example, our protection policies now give your clients – and their families, in some cases – access to up to eight separate support services, at no extra cost.\nMany of you will be familiar with some of them. For instance, the fact that we give policyholders access to an expert second medical opinion through Best Doctors. Or that clients (and their loved ones) can access the Bupa Anytime Healthline to speak to a qualified nurse, 24/7.\nBut you might not know we also give 25% off gym memberships at health clubs throughout the UK (terms and conditions apply). That we offer Income Protection+ clients access to private physio treatment. Or that we provide rapid access to mental health counselling, meaning people don’t have to wait months before receiving treatment.\nWhat clients say\nWhen set against the large lump sums that protection policies pay out, these added extras may seem small. But from speaking to customers and advisers, we know first-hand how important they can prove to clients when it really matters.\nCustomers like Adam Hyde, for instance.\nA former ambulance worker, he received psychotherapy – organised by Aviva – when he was signed off work with stress and anxiety.\nAdam said he was in “a really bad place” when he first called Aviva. But thanks to the support he received, he was able to get back to work in a new job, with a new, more positive frame of mind.\nWith support through the state proving more and more difficult to come by these days, the extras that come bundled with some protection policies are proving increasingly important. They can also make your protection conversations that little bit easier.\nIf you’d like a closer look at the support services that come with our protection policies, speak to your usual Aviva consultant or visit aviva-for-advisers.co.uk today.\n "," 27\n   Is it true that insurers try not to pay out on claims?\nThat’s the perception many people have of insurers – that we’re quick to take money, but not so quick to pay it out.\nYet last year, we paid out more than 97%\nof the protection claims we received, supporting over 25,000 customers and their families.\nLack of trust is a major reason people don’t take out financial protection\n65% of UK adults don’t have any form of protection*. People don’t look at protecting their loved ones in the same way as they do protecting their house, car or even their pet. And what’s one of the main reasons for not taking out financial protection? Not trusting insurers to pay out on a claim.\nSo why is that? We’ve been trying to find out.\nPerception versus reality\nFor our 2018 protection claims report, we spoke to several customers who claimed in 2017.\nBefore claiming, a number of them thought they would need to go through a rigorous process to get their money. And they were pleasantly surprised to find that wasn’t the case.\nWe’re proud of our claims record. Settling over 97% of all claims and paying out £900 million to our customers is what we’re here for. It’s our reason for being.\nContrary to popular opinion, we actively look for reasons to pay out – the complete opposite of public perception.\nWe see how these pay-outs make such a difference to customers which makes it even more frustrating that negative perceptions stop people from getting the cover they might so desperately need in future.\nIt’s time to change the way people think\nPublishing our report is just one way we’ll do this.\nEvery year, there are a small number of cases where we don’t pay out, but, in our report, we clearly outline the reasons why. We\nalso tell some of our customers’ stories to help break open the myth that we make it as difficult as possible for people to get the money they’re due.\nRead Aviva’s 2018 protection claims report https://www.aviva.co.uk/adviser/ documents/view/pt15836c.pdf\nHear from Aviva’s customers\nhttp://www.aviva-for-advisers.co.uk/ adviser/site/public/products/protection/ protection-claims\n* Understanding the financial lives of UK adults, Findings from the FCA’s Financial Lives Survey 2017\n Last year, we paid out over 97% of the protection claims we received\n ","  28\n  Choice\n Ian Berrett | Protection Marketing Manager | Old Mutual Wealth\n“As much money and life as you could want! The two things most\nhuman beings would choose above all – the trouble is, humans do have\na knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.” J K. Rowling, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone\nI’m not really a fan of Harry Potter, but this quote does appeal to me. It can be applied to the simplest of day-to-day choices and to decisions with much greater, life-changing consequences.\nIn the critical illness market the opportunity for choice has grown substantially over the last few years, both in terms of providers and, probably more so, the choices a single product can present. This often includes the choice of cover for a core group of illnesses and conditions or an upgrade to include an additional list of conditions. Similar choices can be made for children’s cover.\nI don’t think choice is a bad thing, but choosing a critical illness policy isn’t easy. There are ever-increasing lists of unfamiliar illnesses to navigate. Choosing whether to include all of these or leave some out, and whether you include children’s cover or not, maybe what level of children’s cover; it’s a lot to consider.\nWe have a slightly different approach. We don’t want you to be faced with a decision of what to choose, or perhaps more crucially, what to leave out. It would be a terrible situation if a client became ill only to find that they cannot claim because their illness is covered by the upgraded cover they chose not to include.\nThis is why the full cover that we offer is the only cover that we offer.\nNumbers aren’t everything\nWe provide full payment for a wide ranging 50 illnesses and conditions, plus additional payments for a further 28 conditions. But numbers aren’t everything. What’s important to us is providing quality cover and that starts with comprehensive cover for the most claimed for conditions.\nThis includes a cancer definition that goes beyond ABI standard, plus cover for a range of less severe cancers and any cancer in situ\nthat requires surgery – no matter where it is in the body.\nWe pay out for any heart attack, whatever the severity. There are a further 13 cardiovascular conditions covered including cardiac arrest and treatment with a pacemaker.\nFor strokes, including spinal, the effects only have to last 24 hours for us to pay out. ‘Eye stroke’ is also covered.\nThese are just three examples and cover extends across neurological conditions, serious accidents and mental illness.\nSupport for long term illness\nFor some of these conditions it’s possible to make a full recovery and return to everyday life, but for some the effects can last far longer. That’s why we include Additional Care Benefit. This additional payment, of up to £50,000, pays when a critical illness leaves\n "," 29\n  In the critical illness market the opportunity for choice has grown substantially over the last few years, both in terms of providers and, probably more so, the choices a single product can present. This often includes the choice of cover for a core group of illnesses and conditions or an upgrade to include an additional list of conditions.\nthe life assured with severe and permanent physical or mental symptoms.\nIn some cases the benefit can be paid at the same time as the claim, in others, where symptoms of the condition become progressively worse, a claim for the additional support can be made up to two years after the initial claim.\nSpeeding up surgery\nI’ve been lucky with my experiences of the NHS, but we all know that for some surgeries waiting lists can be lengthy.\nA number of the conditions require surgery, and for 11 of these we can pay the cover before the surgery takes places, giving the option of private treatment rather than waiting.\nComprehensive cover for children\nProbably one of the greatest worries for\na parent is that their child may become seriously ill. At such a stressful time, the last thing you need is financial difficulty. While our cover will never stop the worry, it can help to ease any financial burden.\nWe cover any number of children from birth to their 22nd birthday and children born after the cover has started will automatically be included - without having to tell us.\nThey’re covered for the same 50 full payments as adults, a further eight child specific illnesses and 27 of the additional payments.\nPayments don’t reduce the main cover and can be doubled if both parents are covered by the policy or each have a separate policy.\nOverseas treatment\nNaturally we want the best care for our children, but sometimes treatment isn’t available in the UK. If treatment is only available outside of the UK, we will double the payment.\nThat means if both parents are covered we could pay up to a total maximum of £100,000 in total.\nChildren’s cover also includes surgery benefit, an additional £10,000 for an advanced illness and £5,000 life cover.\nWhen is a child not a child?\nSo what happens when they reach 22? They’ll always be ‘children’ to their parents but not by the definitions of our policy.\nThey may have their own income, and bills to pay which is why we include First Time Cover.\nIt gives the child no longer covered the opportunity to apply for their own, full adult cover, of up to £50,000 if both parents are covered, without any health questions.\nThere for you\nWhen we talk about comprehensive we mean more than helping to relieve the financial difficulties.\nOur There for You service can provide the kind of emotional and practical support that a client may not get as part of their treatment by connecting them with a RedArc nurse adviser.\nAvailable at any time, without having to claim, and at no extra cost, the service provides second medical opinions, counselling and therapies, care advice, and so much more – enough for another article!\nImportantly, the one-on-one support with the same nurse adviser is available to the client and their family for as long as it’s required.\nAnd so, back to choice. A policy that\noffers many choices or a policy that offers comprehensive cover as standard?

Although London has been ranked the world’s capital for global\nfinancial services, it does however rank disappointingly below average for its teaching of financial literacy. Surprised? I was, so I thought I would take it upon myself to survey the offspring of my colleagues and ask parents how they think children should be educated in the ways of finance and their long-term financial security.\nBefore we delve into the feedback, whose job is it to educate our children on financial matters; just parents, or school as well, or only society in general, when perhaps it’ll be too late? In my opinion, it’s all three, with our children needing good role models to follow so they can apply what they have learned when going into our wider society.\nBack to the survey, and the cross-section of children and parents quizzed were asked\nabout matters ranging from, “What is income protection?” to “Do they have targets when saving?” Is it fair to say that I didn’t expect them to know too much, if anything, about insurance, as anything they have learned already at school or from parents would be around saving, but nonetheless, the answers made for some revealing and interesting reading, and aren’t short of talking points!\nI started off by asking “What do you think ‘protection’ means in a financial context?” None of the respondents were expected\nto speak ‘financia-lese’, so other than the predictable “no” responses, which was a fair answer for ages ranging from 10 – 21, those responses returned, whether right or wrong, made complete sense – “the protection of one’s money,” and, “protecting financial information.” It’s great that GDPR seems to have possibly crept into their psyche, perhaps also not a surprise the word ‘insurance’ didn’t feature in any replies, however, by extending the question to, “what do you need to protect, if you take a mortgage or rent a house?”, answers seemed more thought through, varying between, “protecting the money you pay for rent or a mortgage”, to “home/legal insurance and life insurance”, to\n“need to protect any debt, and your money, yes, you need to protect the salary that you earn each month”.\nThen came the trickier questions like “what does income protection do?”, and “What is term assurance?” Perhaps, based on these answers, albeit a small sample size, as an industry we do need to rethink the naming convention of our products. I’ll start with term assurance. “No idea”, was the most common riposte.\nIn fact, there was only one answer other than that, which was “future planning – like putting money away for a holiday”. Now I’m not saying we need to change it on the back of one reply from a 21-year-old, but it has been a while since you would have surely had to explain a term like this:\nTerm Life Assurance is a policy that provides coverage at a fixed rate of payments for a limited period, the relevant term. After that period expires, coverage at the previous rate of premiums is no longer guaranteed and the client must either forgo coverage or potentially obtain further coverage with different payments or conditions. If the\nlife insured dies during the term, the death\nSource: Independent\n ","     31\n                              Have I got a solution for all IFAs?

Term insurance is typically the least expensive way to purchase a substantial death benefit on a coverage amount over a specific period.\nThanks to Wikipedia for that clarity, but surely one could just say it is life insurance that pays out if you die during the term of the policy? You then tag on the essential trust discussion, but can’t we look to move towards product names that mean something to us all, ones that evolve as different generations grow up and take the protection they will need, especially in this world dictated by money and spending?\nWe all know income protection is a different beast. Let those surveyed tell you why.\nIt can mean literally anything to anyone, whether you work in financial services or not. Apparently, IP is a “security tool to stop people stealing your money online or by hacking”, or it’s “when an insurance man knocks on your door and demands protection money”. Man from the Pru, you have so much to answer to!\nWe did get closer to the right answer though. To one teenager it is “when you have income from a job you put some into a protection scheme in case something happens to you.” A good start, however I am told the discussion\nquickly descended into dying your hair\nand moving home like you’re in a witness protection scheme! Others did however, and it was the younger children who grasped the fact that IP “protects the income you get, income being what you earn from work and this would be something that would pay you if your work didn’t”, and, “protects your income”!\nThe saving grace though could be saving. Something this bunch of Alphas and Generation Zs take very seriously - well almost. There are some caveats. One 13-year-old saves “for an expensive item but if something else comes along that I also want,\nI get my parents to buy one of them for me”, but overall, saving and budgeting were high on everyone’s agenda, although marrying a millionaire still got a look in.\nSo, what’s the answer from this snapshot? Some funny anecdotes, but in the main each young person canvassed expressed the same overarching approach to finances, in that they will take it very seriously in the future, once and if the bank of mum and dad ever closes its doors for a final time!\nWhat about the parents then? A couple of highlights stand out. The first being, “Hmm, don’t really talk about the detail very much but they do know our property is our main\ninvestment for now, that money is being\nset aside for a uni fund, if required, and that we have policies in place if the worst were\nto happen. It’s the sort of thing that I never spoke about with my parents and in hindsight I seemed to have passed that down”.\nAnother was, “We do try to talk about finances with them occasionally and we have a few things in place to help support their future. In terms of educating them about finances, we dabbled with the Go Henry card to get them used to managing money and thinking about saving, but we stopped it as the novelty soon wore off and the monthly subscription of £3 became more than the amount being earned for doing tasks around the house”!\nHave I got a solution for all IFAs? No, I don’t think so yet, but I would strongly urge you to think about talking to your clients, who have children, and asking them to talk to their children about all matters financial,\nin whatever level of detail. I’d also love to hear how you explain insurance products\nto your customers and maybe we can get\nan aide memoire produced to help advisers, customers, and possibly educators.

Bernstein proposes that the success of human ingenuity in modern times is as a result of the mastery of risk.\nThe mix of science and art practiced by financial planners is an advanced form of what has driven intellectual development from\nthe explosion of technological, cultural and societal progress in the 17th century during the Enlightenment: ‘The revolutionary idea that defines the boundary between modern times and the past is the mastery of risk’.\nBy defining a ‘rational process of risk-\ntaking’ the true nature of modern progress was revealed. In Bernstein’s words, ‘Risk management guides us over a vast range of decision-making, from allocating wealth to safe-guarding public health, from waging war to planning a family, from paying insurance premiums to wearing a seatbelt, from planting corn to marketing cornflakes’.\nAn understanding of risk evolved through the work of a series of intellectual giants; ‘mathematicians transformed probability theory into a powerful instrument for organising, interpreting, and applying information.’\nModern stochastic techniques can rightfully (in our view) claim to be full expressions of\nwhat has evolved since 1654 when Pascal first introduced the concept of probability\nas a means of solving problems. Modern students of investment may be more familiar with Nobel Laureate Harry Markowitz, whose mathematical insights produced Portfolio Theory with its Efficient Frontier and explained the enormous benefits of diversification.\nModern investment strategies also capture another pivotal idea from the 18th century. Swiss mathematician Daniel Bernoulli wrote a paper identifying the concept of ‘utility’ where ‘the value of an item must not be based on its price, but on the utility that\nit yields’. Subjectivity is as important part\nof decision making and risk assessment as probability. Even though outcomes can be predicted, different people value different outcomes. Investors may or may not be comfortable taking on investment risk, based on subjective considerations, usually relating to their existing financial circumstances or their aspirations to grow wealth. In short, this is the familiar territory of advisers undertaking psychometric questionnaires with clients.\nIn our industry, there is a growing realisation that forward looking techniques that\nseek to describe the universe of ‘viable’ investment outcomes provides a more reliable methodology for managing investment risk than more traditional analysis predicated on historical returns, including historical volatility.\nThe kind of mathematical analysis referenced above is generated by a stochastic engine comprising rules that describe the behaviour and inter-relation of the constituents of the model (for example interest rates or asset class growth rates), coupled with powerful simulation, creating thousands of viable outcomes.\nIt is very difficult to predict the outcome of an investment in the short term, but in the longer term, the power of probability kicks in and\nwe can predict much more accurately. It is a similar explanation as to why a dice may have 1 out of 6 outcomes in a throw, meaning the next throw is impossible to predict. However, throw a dice 10k times and the outcome can be predicted with certainty.\n ","     35\n                          The real challenge for many advisers is that MiFID II has introduced the concept of ex-ante and ex-post research, meaning that full suitability must be established in advance of a transaction and at every review.\nRisk, MiFID II and the advice process\nHaving a well-structured approach to risk profiling and managing investment risk is no longer optional in the MiFID environment. We have written and posted a ‘white paper’ that is available on the Synaptic website. The purpose of this paper is to provide insight into the mechanics of risk and return, on\nthe premise that improved management of investment risk with clients can be delivered through an effective, modern investment strategy. In the paper, we cover the following fundamentals:\n• Risk profiling of clients The real challenge for many advisers is that\n• Building an efficient frontier using MiFID II has introduced the concept of ex-\n‘Value at Risk’ measure (rather than ante and ex-post research, meaning that full\nvolatility) suitability must be established in advance of a\n• The role of asset allocation in transaction and at every review.\nforming probability-based models for\ninvestment outcomes\n• How to measure and compare risk\ninherent in investment\n• The role of risk in retirement planning\n• Longevity of investment and\nsustainable withdrawals\nBoth screens below from Synaptic Modeller show the analysis of a client’s investment on the left, to be compared on the right with the analysis of the Strategic Asset Allocation for the appropriate Risk Category, in this case Balanced (hi end in our 1-10 range, level 6).\n  If you have any concerns about your firm’s ability to meet the challenges of MiFID II, risk and proof of Suitability, consider adopting the Synaptic Risk Ratings.

This research was a landmark in establishing a new kind of calculation, but Bengen’s research only dealt with US historical returns, and our intention here is to outline how Bengen’s approach might be applied in a UK retirement context today, using modern stochastic techniques.\nFirst of all, the use of cash-flow plans\nAs readers will know, cash-flow models are prescribed for DB transfers, but in his recent report ’An-ex-regulator’s guide to cash-flow planning’, Rory Percival explains why cash- flow plans should be taking centre stage in a wider context of advice:\n• ‘Cash-flow planning can be about any form of income and outgoings and does not have to be related to the client’s overall position.’ A cash-flow plan need not be a holistic view of a client’s finances.\n• The second point is that the cash-flow plan can establish a client’s Capacity\nfor Loss for most clients. In fact, writes the author, ‘it should be the main way of assessing Capacity for Loss for most clients.’ Capacity for Loss is the lynchpin of compliance, and meeting the funding requirement for future income is central\nto any plan. An adviser needs to make an expert, objective assessment of Capacity for Loss, or using its FCA definition, identify the level at which loss may make a ‘material impact on the standard of living’.\nMoody’s overview of sustainable retirement income\nSynaptic users can use growth assumptions from the Synaptic Risk profile, but the calculations remain deterministic. In our\nview, retirement advice is most effectively delivered using a combination of cash-flow modelling and stochastic analysis. In the last edition of this publication, we provided graphs illustrating the ‘longevity’ of retirement funds, created by Synaptic Modeller.\nAdditionally, we wanted to show you one more graph that beautifully captures the role of investment risk, the impact of withdrawals and probability of success.\nThe graph shows a greater than 80% chance of success (income sustainability over 25 years) for everything:\n• With a greater investment risk than -0.1, which is equivalent to a portfolio with Moderately Cautious risk profile (loss of up to 10% of portfolio in a bad (1 in 20) year).\n• Drawing down 5% or less of portfolio (adjusted for inflation). The 0-800 are bps i.e. 400 is 4%. Notice also that the classic 4% level of income will return a 90% chance of success if the funds are invested above Moderately Cautious Strategy.\n• Summary – investment risk is obligatory for meeting most retirement investment needs!\n "," 37\n  Additionally, we wanted to show you one more graph that beautifully captures the role of investment risk, impact of withdrawal and probability of success.\n                                   Moody’s 2-risk chart. Decumulation Strategies\n What’s shown?\n• 25-year retirement decumulation projections for portfolios ranging from 0% to 100% equity, for a range of fixed income levels.\n• The Strategic Asset Allocations (SAAs) used are a blend of Equity (70% Global\nex UK; 30% UK) and UK Fixed Income. EBR (Equity Backing Ratio, i.e. proportion of equity) is stepped in 5% increments from 0% to 100% - shown on the chart as points.\n• For each set of Strategic Asset Allocations, we run a decumulation scenario with fixed income level ranging from 0% to 8% of the initial fund. Lines show constant income levels, as specified in the RH legend: 0bps, 30bps, 70bps, 100bps, 130 bps and so on.\n• For reference, the current single life fixed annuity rate is about 5.0% for a 65-year old – shown as a red dashed line.\n• On the y axis is income sustainability, i.e. probability of maintaining the stated income to age 90.\n• On the x axis is max 1yr 95% var. That is, the maximum 1-year loss at the 1 in 20 level over the investment horizon. This loss reflects losses on the fund due to investment returns only and does not reflect the income cashflows.\nWhat does it mean?\nThis is a “2-risk” chart showing two of the principle sources of investment risk for decumulation investors: “shortfall risk”, as represented on the y-axis in terms of “income sustainability”, and “market risk” represented on the x axis as the “potential 1yr loss”.\nUse of retirement withdrawal statements\nSynaptic recommends the use of retirement withdrawal statements to anticipate\nthe various market conditions. Abraham Okusanya has written a fantastic book, Beyond the 4% Rule, that explains the maths and the various rules that can be applied in more detail than we have room for here.\nTo make a withdrawal statement work, the adviser should establish the probability-based parameters for success or failure (easy with the Moody’s model), and signpost the likely responses. The latter will include several simple rules that can be applied, for example the expectation of increasing the withdrawal rate by inflation, except when the portfolio has lost 10% over any 12-month period. Inflation-linked increases to be resumed when the portfolio has regained the former valuation. The rules to address different market conditions are also the best way to demonstrate the suitability of the plan, as the\nrules will be designed to prevent the depletion of the principal and breach of the client’s Capacity for Loss. Abraham Okusanya’s\nbook ‘Beyond the 4% Rule’ is a great place to research the various strategies in more detail.\nA major concern of course is the cognitive ability of the client (and the adviser!) in later years, so the due diligence and research needs to be very thorough, including a detailed understanding of how the reviews will be undertaken.\nThere are many interesting considerations that come out of this research, for example, how different asset allocations and investment styles might work; whether the use of natural yield to determine withdrawal rates might help, or what happens when you allow the asset classes to drift, which again provides some interesting results and options for the adviser.\n Article is an extract from the Synaptic Risk White Paper, available to download at www.synaptic.co.uk/risk\n","                                            Risk and suitability in a perfect ‘10’\n         • Synaptic Modeller provides complete risk and suitability and investment risk management for head offices, paraplanners and advisers, combining Moody’s Analytics investment strategy and stochastic projections\n• Accurate and consistent values for downside risk that can be used to align Capacity for Loss with risk in chosen investments\n• Includes fully integrated ATR Questionnaire, Asset Allocations and stochastic engine for illustrative projections\n• Synaptic Modeller offers key Moody’s probability based risk metrics: the Value at Risk in any given investment scenario and the investment outcome\n• Adviser controls inputs for investment amount, term, costs including adviser charges\n• Perfectly complements RSMR qualitative research, accessible through Synaptic Product and Fund Fact sheets\n• Integrates with Intelliflo via iO Store\n                              Synaptic Modeller is now available with 1-10 risk categories as well as 1-5, defined by Moody’s Analytics asset allocations\n  Synaptic Modeller is available as a standalone module from £50 per month.

You should consult Royal London directly for further information before recommending.\nAbout the service: Synaptic Risk Ratings are worked out by analysing the underlying asset classes within the fund or portfolio. Synaptic Software have requested asset allocation information from participating providers in a specific format aligned to the risk framework of the system. These asset classes are used by the model to determine the risk rating, a process that may result in a level of approximation though in most cases this will be insignificant. It is also possible that certain asset classes may not be represented exactly in the manner that providers would prefer.\nReasonable endeavours are made to provide accuracy and consistency, however neither participating providers nor Synaptic Software can be held responsible for any errors or omissions. No recommendation should be made solely on the basis of the Synaptic Risk Ratings, and additional research should be undertaken for any case. This service is intended for use by investment professionals only.\n    ","                                                            THE NEW WHITE PAPER\nEnabling better outcomes in financial planning by optimising investment risk and reward using stochastic modelling\nDownload your free copy today\nwww.synaptic.co.uk/risk\nHow to improve your\nSynaptic Modeller is now available\nwith 1-10 risk categories as well as 1-5, defined by Moody’s Analytic’s\ninvestment performance\nand optimise risk\nasset allocations\n  Features research and calculations from\nMoody’s Analytics\n  ","                Win the protection clients you want.\nFaster.\nTake your advice business to the next level with Adviser Business Accelerator.\nDiscover tips, tools and guides to help you win more protection clients and boost your profits.
